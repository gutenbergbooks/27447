<p>The fiery disk of the sun was just lifting above
the shoulder of hills that held the city of
Stenton when the Greenstream stage rolled
briskly from its depot, a dingy frame tavern, and
commenced the long journey to its high destination.
The tavern was on the outskirts of town; beyond, a
broad, level plain reached to a shimmering blue silhouette
of mountains printed on a silvery sky; and
the stage immediately left the paved street for the
soft, dusty country road. Stenton was not yet astir;
except for an occasional maid sleepily removing the
milk from gleaming marble steps, or early workmen
with swollen, sullen countenances, the streets were
deserted. The dewy freshness of morning was already
lost in the rapidly mounting heat of the June
day. Above the blackened willows that half hid
the waterworks an oily column of smoke wavered
upward in slow, thick coils, mingling with the acid
odor of ammonia from a neighboring ice manufacturing
plant; a locomotive whistled harsh and persistent;
the heat vibrated in visible fans above the
pavement.</p>
<p>From the vantage point of the back porches of
Stenton the sluggish maids could see the Greenstream
stage fast diminishing. The dust rose and enveloped
it, until it appeared to be a ball, gilded by
the sun, rolling over the rank grey-green plain.
Finally it disappeared from the vision of the awakening
city.</p>

<p>It was a mountain surrey, with a top and rolled
curtains, three rigid seats, and drawn by ugly,
powerful horses in highly simplified harness.
At the rear a number of mailbags, already coated
with a dun film, were securely strapped.</p>
<p>The driver lounged forward, skilfully picking
flies with his whip from the horses&#8217; backs. He had
a smooth countenance, deeply tanned, and pale, clear
blue eyes. At his side sat a priest in black, a man
past middle age, with ashen, embittered lips, and a
narrowed, chilling gaze. They were silent, contemplative;
but, from the seat behind them, flowed
a constant, buoyant, youthful chatter. A girl with
a shining mass of chestnut hair gathered loosely on
a virgin neck was recounting the thrilling incidents
of &#8220;commencement week&#8221; for the benefit of a heavily-built
young man with a handsome, masklike
countenance. On the last seat a carelessly-garbed
male was drawing huge clouds of smoke from a formidable
cigar.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon, the driver, did not know the
latter. He had engaged and paid for his seat the
night before, evading such indirect query as Makimmon
had addressed to him. It was a fundamental
principle of Greenstream conduct that the direct
question was inadmissible; at the same time, the inhabitants
of that far, isolated valley were, on all
occasions, coldly curious about such strangers, their
motives and complexions of mind, as reached their
self-sufficient territory. This combined restriction
and necessity produced a wily type of local inquisitor.
But here Gordon&#8217;s diplomacy had been in
vain, his surmising at sea. The others were intimate
and familiar figures:</p>
<p>Father Merlier&#8217;s advent into Greenstream had occurred
a number of years before. He had arrived
with papers of introduction to one of the few papist
families in that rigorously protestant neighborhood;
and, immediately, had erected outside the village of
Greenstream a small mission school and dwelling,
where he addressed himself to the herculean task
of gaining converts to his faith. At first he had
been regarded with unconcealed distrust&mdash;boys,
when the priest&#8217;s back was turned, had thrown
stones at him; the turbulent element, on more than
one occasion, had discussed the advisability of &#8220;running&#8221;
him from the community. But it was true
of both boys and men that, when they had confronted
the beady, black glitter of Merlier&#8217;s unfaltering
gaze, encountered the patent contempt of his rigid
lips, they had subsided into an unintelligible mutter,
and had been glad to escape.</p>
<p>He became an habitual sight, riding a blooded
mare through the valley, over lonely trails, and was
finally accepted as a recognized local institution.
His title and exotic garb, the grim quality of his
manhood, his austere disregard for bodily welfare,
his unmistakable courage&mdash;more than any other
human quality extolled throughout Greenstream&mdash;became
a cause of prideful boasting in the County.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon had known Lettice Hollidew,
now speaking in little, girlish rushes behind him,
since her first appearance in a baby carriage, nineteen
or twenty years back. He had watched her
without particular interest, the daughter of the richest
man in Greenstream, grow out of sturdy, barelegged
childhood into the girl he had now for five
years been driving, in early summer and fall, to and
from the boarding school at Stenton.</p>
<p>She was, he had noted, reserved. Other schoolgirls,
in their passages from their scattered upland
homes, were eager to share Gordon&#8217;s seat by the
whip; and, with affected giggling, or ringing bursts
of merriment, essayed to drive the wise, heedless
mountain horses. But Lettice Hollidew had always
shrunk from the prominent place on the stage; there
was neither banter nor invitation in her tones as she
greeted him at the outset of their repeated trips,
or as she gravely thanked him at the end of the day&#8217;s
journey.</p>
<p>Her father&mdash;he was reputed to possess almost
half a million dollars&mdash;was a silent man, suspicious
and wary in his contact and dealings with the world;
and it was probable that those qualities had been
softened in Pompey Hollidew&#8217;s daughter to a
habit of diffidence, to a customary, instinctive repression.</p>
<p>No such characteristics laid their restraint on
Buckley Simmons, her present companion. His immobile
face, with its heavy, good features and slow-kindling
comprehension, was at all times expressive
of loud self-assertion, insatiable curiosity, facile confidence;
from his clean shaven lips fell always satisfied
comment, pronouncement, impatient opinion.
If Hollidew was the richest man in Greenstream
Valentine Simmons was a close second. Indeed, one
might be found as wealthy as the other; as a matter
of fact, the Simmons holdings in real estate, scattered
broadcast over the county, would realize more
than Hollidew could readily command&mdash;thus Valentine
Simmons&#8217; son, Buckley.</p>
<p>He was elaborately garbed in grey serge, relentlessly
shaped to conform to an exaggerated, passing
fashion, a flaring china silk tie with a broadly displayed
handkerchief to match, yellow-red shoes with
wide ribbands, and a stiff, claret-colored felt hat.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon, with secret dissatisfaction,
compared himself with this sartorial model. Gordon&#8217;s
attire, purely serviceable, had apparently
taken on a protective coloring from the action of
time and the elements; his shirt had faded from a
bright buff to a nondescript shade which blended
with what had once been light corduroy trousers;
his heavy shoes, treated only the evening before to
a coat of preservative grease, were now covered with
muck; and, pulled over his eyes, a shapeless canvas
hat completed the list of the visible items of his
appearance.</p>
<p>He swore moodily to himself as he considered the
picture he must present to the dapper youth and immaculate
girl behind him. He should have remembered
that Lettice Hollidew would be returning
from school to-day, and at least provided an emergency
collar. His sister Clare was always scolding
him about his clothes&nbsp;...&nbsp;but Clare&#8217;s was very gentle
scolding.</p>
<p>A species of uncomfortable defiance, a studied
contempt for appearance, possessed him: he was as
good any day as Buckley Simmons, the clothes on
whose back had probably been stripped from the
desperate need of some lean mountain inhabitant
trading at the parental Simmons&#8217; counter. The
carefully cherished sense of injury grew within him;
he suspected innuendoes, allusions to his garb, in the
half-heard conversation behind him; he spoke to
his horses in hard, sharp tones, and, without reason,
swept the whip across their ears.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, they drew steadily over the
plain; the mountains before them gradually
lost their aspect of mere silhouette;
depths were discernible; the blue dissolved to green,
to towering slopes dense with foliage. Directly before
them a dark shadow steadily grew darker, until
it was resolved into a cleft through the range. They
drew nearer and nearer to the pierced barrier, the
road mounted perceptibly, the trees thickened by the
wayside. A covey of dun partridge fluttered out of
the underbrush.</p>
<p>The sun was high in a burning grey vault, and
flooded the plain with colorless, bright light. The
stage paused before entering the opening in the
rocky wall; the stranger in the rear seat turned for
a comprehensive, last survey. Simmering in a calorific
envelope the distant roofs and stacks of Stenton
were visible, isolated in the white heat of the
pitiless day. Above the city hung a smudge, a
thumbprint of oily black smoke, carrying the suggestion
of an intolerable concentration, a focal
point of the fiery discomfort. In the foreground a
buzzard wheeled, inevitable, depressing.</p>
<p>With a sharp flourish of his whip Gordon urged
the stage into the cold humidity of the gorge. Stenton
and the plain were lost as it passed between
close, dripping rocks, rank verdure, masses of gigantic,
paleolithic fern.</p>

<p>The dank, green smell hung in their nostrils
after they had left the ravine for a fertile
tableland. They trotted through a village
strung along the road, a village of deeply-scrolled
eaves under the thick foliage of maples, of an incredible
number of churches&mdash;&#8220;Reformed,&#8221; &#8220;Established,&#8221;
qualified Methodist, uncompromising Baptist.
They were all built of wood, and in varying
states of repair that bore mute witness to the persuasive
eloquence of their several pastors.</p>
<p>Beyond, the way rose once more, sunny and dusty
and monotonous. The priest was absorbed, muttering
unintelligibly over a small, flexible volume.
The conversation between Lettice Hollidew and
Buckley fell into increasing periods of silence. The
stranger lit a fresh cigar, the smoke from which
hung out back in such clouds that the power of the
stage might well have been mistaken for steam.</p>
<p>The road grew steeper still, and, fastening the
reins about the whipstock, Gordon swung out over
the wheel and walked. He was a spare man,
sinewy and upright, and past the golden age of
youth. He lounged over the road in a careless manner
that concealed his agile strength, his tireless
endurance. This indolent carriage and his seemingly
slight build had, on more than one occasion,
been disastrously misleading to importunate or beery
strangers. He could, and did, fight whenever
chance offered, with a cold passion, a destructive
abandon, that had won him, throughout the turbulent
confines of Greenstream, a flattering measure of
peace.</p>
<p>In this manner his father, just such another, had
fought before him, and his grandfather before that.
Nothing further back was known in Greenstream,
It was well known that the first George Gordon Makimmon&mdash;the
Mac had been speedily debauched by
the slurring, local speech&mdash;had made his way to
Virginia from Scotland, upon the final collapse of
a Lost Cause. The instinct of the highlander had
led him deep into the rugged ranges, where he had
lived to see the town and county of Greenstream
crystallize about his log walls and stony patch.</p>
<p>There, finally breaking down the resistance of a
heroic constitution, he had succeeded in drinking
himself to death. His son had grown up imbued
with local tradition and ideas, and was settling seriously
to a repetition of the elder&#8217;s fate, when the
Civil War offered him a wide, recognized field for
the family belligerent spirit. He was improving
this chance to the utmost with Morley&#8217;s Raiders
when a slug ended his activities in the second year
of the war.</p>
<p>It was characteristic of the Makimmons that they
should each have left their family in precarious circumstances.
They were not, they would contemptuously
assert, farmers or merchants. When the timber
was cut from the valley, the underbrush burned,
and the superb cloth of grass started that had
formed the foundation of a number of comfortable
fortunes, the Makimmons, scornful of the effort, had
remained outside the profit.</p>
<p>Such income as they enjoyed had been obtained
from renting their acres to transient and indifferent
farmers. In the crises of life and death, or under
the desire for immediate and more liquor, they sold
necessary slices. This continued until nothing remained
for the present Gordon Makimmon but the
original dwelling&mdash;now grotesquely misshapen from
the addition of casual sheds and extensions&mdash;and a
small number of acres on the outskirts of town.</p>
<p>There he lived with Clare, his sister. Their
mother, the widow of that Makimmon whose disputatious
temper had been dignified by the epitaph
of &#8220;heroic sacrifice,&#8221; had died of a complicity of
patent medicines the winter before. An older
brother had totally disappeared from the cognizance
of Greenstream during Gordon&#8217;s boyhood; and a
married sister, completing the tale, lived at the opposite
end of the county, held close by poverty and
her own large brood.</p>
<p>Summer and winter Gordon Makimmon drove
the stage between Greenstream and Stenton. At
dawn he left Greenstream, arriving in Stenton at
the end of day; the following morning he re-departed
for Greenstream. This mechanical, monotonous
routine satisfied his need without placing too great
a strain on his energy; he enjoyed rolling over the
summer roads or in the crisp clear sunlight of winter;
he liked the casual converse of the chance passengers,
the inevitable deference to his local knowledge,
the birdlike chatter and flattery of the young
women. He liked, so easily, to play oracle and
wiseman; he liked the admiration called forth by a
certain theatrical prowess with the reins and whip.</p>
<p>On the occasions when he was too drunk to drive&mdash;not
over often&mdash;a substitute was quietly found
until he recovered and little was said. Gordon
Makimmon was invaluable in a public charge, a
trust&mdash;he had never lost a penny of the funds he
continually carried for deposit in the Stenton banks;
no insult had been successfully offered to any daughter
of Greenstream accompanying him without other
care in the stage.</p>

<p>They rose steadily, crossing the roof of a
ridge, and descended abruptly beyond.
Green prospects opened before them&mdash;a
broad valley was disclosed, with a broad, shallow
stream dividing its meadows; scattered farmhouses,
orderly, prosperous, commanded their shorn acres.
A mailbag was detached and left at a crossroad
in charge of two little girls, primly important,
smothered in identical, starched pink sunbonnets.
The Greenstream stage splashed through the shallow,
shining ford; the ascent on the far side of the
valley imperceptibly began.</p>
<p>The sun was almost at the zenith; the shadow of
the stage fell short and sharp on the dry, loamy
road; a brown film covered the horses and vehicle;
it sifted through the apparel of the passengers and
coated their lips. The rise to the roof of the succeeding
range seemed interminable; the road looped
fields blue with buckwheat, groves of towering, majestic
chestnut, a rocky slope, where, by a crevice, a
swollen and sluggish rattlesnake dropped from sight.</p>
<p>At last, in the valley beyond, the half-way house,
dinner and a change of horses were reached. The
forest swept down in an unbroken tide to the porch
of the isolated roadside tavern; a swift stream filled
the wooden structure with the ceaseless murmur of
water. In the dusty, gold gloom of a spacious
stable Gordon unhitched his team. Outside, in a
wooden trough, he splashed his hands and face,
then entered the dining-room.</p>
<p>A long table was occupied by an industrious company
that broke the absorbed silence only by explosive
requests for particularized dishes. Above the
table hovered the wife of the proprietor, constantly
waving a fly brush&mdash;streamers of colored paper
fastened to a slender stick&mdash;above the heads of her
husband and guests.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon ate largely and rapidly, ably
seconded by the strange passenger and Buckley
Simmons. The priest, Merlier, ate sparingly, in
an absent, perfunctory manner. Lettice Hollidew,
at the opposite end of the table, displayed the generous
but dainty appetite of girlhood. The coat
to her suit, with a piece of lace pinned about the
collar, and a new, flat leather bag with a silver
initial, hung from the back of her chair.</p>
<p>They again listlessly took their places in the stage.
Buckley Simmons emulated the stranger in lighting
a mahogany-colored cigar with an ornamental band
which Buckley moved toward his lips before the
swiftly approaching conflagration. Gordon drove
with his mind pleasantly vacant, lulled by the monotonous
miles of road flickering through his vision,
the shifting forms of distant peaks, virid vistas,
nearby trees and bushes, all saturated in the slumberous,
yellow, summer heat.</p>
<p>Gradually the aspect of their surroundings
changed, the forms of the mountains grew bolder,
streams raced whitely over broken, rocky beds; the
ranks of the forest closed up, only a rare trail broke
the road. The orderly farmhouses, the tilled fields,
disappeared; a rare cabin, roughly constructed of
unbarked logs, dominated a parched patch, cut from
the heart-breaking tangle of the wild, a thread of
smoke creeping from a precarious chimney above
the far, unbroken canopy of living green. Children
with matted hair, beady-eyed like animals, in bag-like
slips, filled the doorways; adults, gaunt-jawed
and apathetic, straightened momentarily up from
their toil with the stubborn earth.</p>
<p>At the sharpest ascent yet encountered Gordon
again left the stage. Buckley Simmons recalled a
short cut through the wood, and noisily entreated
Lettice Hollidew to accompany him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awfully pretty,&#8221; he urged, &#8220;and easy; no
rocks to cut your shoes. I&#8217;ll go ahead with a stick
to look out for snakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shuddered charmingly at the final item, and
vowed she would not go a step. But he persisted,
and in the end persuaded her. The stranger continued
unmoved in his place; Merlier shifted not a
pound&#8217;s weight, but sat with a cold, indifferent face
turned upon the straining horses.</p>
<p>Gordon walked ahead, whistling under his breath,
and, with a single skilful twist, he rolled a cigarette
from a muslin bag of tobacco labeled Green Goose.</p>
<p>The short cut into which Buckley and Lettice Hollidew
disappeared refound the road, Gordon knew,
over a mile above; and he was surprised, shortly, to
see the girl&#8217;s white waist moving rapidly into the
open. She was alone, breathing in excited gasps,
which she struggled to subdue. Her face that five
minutes before had been so creamily, placidly composed
was now hotly red; her eyes shone with angry,
unshed tears.</p>
<p>Gordon&#8217;s lips formed a silent exclamation&nbsp;...&nbsp;Buckley
evidently had made an error in judgment.
Lettice stepped out into the road, and, plainly unwilling
to encounter the questioning eyes in the stage,
walked rigidly beside Gordon. Behind the obvious
confusion, the hurt surprise of her countenance, an
unexpected, dormant quality had been stirred into
being. The crimson flood in her cheeks had stained
more than her clear skin&mdash;it had colored her gracile
and candid girlhood so that it would never again be
pellucid; into it had been spilled some of the indelible
dye of woman.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon gazed with newly-awakened
interest at Lettice; for the first time he thought of
her as other than a school-girl; for the first time he
discovered in her the potent, magnetic, disturbing
quality of sex. Buckley Simmons had clumsily
forced it into consciousness. A fleeting, unformulated
regret enveloped him in the shadow of its
melancholy, an intangible, formless sorrow at the
swift passage of youth, the inevitable lapse of time.
A mounting anger at Buckley possessed him&nbsp;...&nbsp;she
had been in his, Gordon Makimmon&#8217;s, care.
The anger touched his pride, his self-esteem, and
grew cold, deliberate: he watched with a contracted
jaw for Simmons&#8217; appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he exclaimed, in a lowered voice, &#8220;that
lown tore your pretty shirtwaist!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He had no reason at all,&#8221; she protested; &#8220;it
was just horrid.&#8221; A little shiver ran over her.
&#8220;He&nbsp;...&nbsp;he held me and kissed&nbsp;...&nbsp;hateful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll teach him to keep his kissing where it&#8217;s
liked,&#8221; Gordon proclaimed. His instinctively
theatrical manner diminished not a jot the menace
of the threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! please, please don&#8217;t fight.&#8221; She turned a
deeply concerned countenance upon him. &#8220;That
would hurt me very much more&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be a fight,&#8221; he reassured her, &#8220;only a
little hint, something for Buck to think about. No
one will know.&#8221; He could not resist adding,
&#8220;Most people go a good length before fighting with
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard that you are awfully&mdash;&#8221; she hesitated,
then, &#8220;brave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was &#8217;ugly&#8217; you heard,&#8221; he quickly supplied
the pause. &#8220;But that&#8217;s not true; I don&#8217;t fight like
some men, just for a good time. Why, in the towns
over the West Virginia line they fight all night;
they&#8217;ll fight&mdash;kill each other&mdash;for two bits, or a
drink of liquor.... There&#8217;s Buckley now, coming
in above.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buckley Simmons entered the road from a narrow
trail a number of yards ahead of the stage. He
tramped heavily, holding a hickory switch in one
hand, cutting savagely at the underbrush. The
stage leisurely caught up to him until the horses&#8217;
heads were opposite his thickset form. Gordon,
from the other side of the team, swung himself into
his seat. He grasped the whip, and, leaning out,
swept the heavy leather thong in a vicious circle.
It whistled above the horses, causing them to plunge,
and the lash, stopped suddenly, drew across Buckley
Simmons&#8217; face. For an instant his startled countenance
was white, and then it was wet, gleaming
and scarlet. He pressed his hands to his mouth, and
stumbled confused into the ditch.</p>
<p>Gordon stopped the stage. Merlier gave vent to
a sibilant exclamation, and Lattice Hollidew covered
her eyes. The stranger sprang to the road,
and hurried to the injured man&#8217;s side. Gordon got
down slowly. &#8220;Where did it get him?&#8221; he inquired,
with a shallow show of concern. He regarded with
indifferent eyes the gaping cut across Simmons&#8217; jaw,
while the stranger was converting a large linen
handkerchief into a ready bandage.</p>
<p>Buckley, in stammering, shocked rage, began to
curse Gordon&#8217;s clumsiness, and, in his excitement,
the wound bled more redly. &#8220;You will have to
keep quiet,&#8221; he was told, &#8220;for this afternoon anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a &#8217;dam&#8217; blind bat,&#8221; Gordon informed
his victim in a rapid undertone; &#8220;my eyes are
sharper than usual to-day.&#8221; Above the stained
bandage Simmons&#8217; gaze was blankly enraged.
&#8220;That won&#8217;t danger you none,&#8221; Gordon continued,
in louder, apparently unstudied tones; &#8220;but you
can&#8217;t kiss the girls for a couple of weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buckley Simmons was assisted into the rear seat;
Lettice sat alone, her face hidden by the flowery
rim of her hat; Merlier was silent, indifferent, bland.
The way grew increasingly wilder, and climbed and
climbed; at their back dipped and spread mile upon
mile of unbroken hemlock; the minute clearings, the
solitary cabins, were lost in the still expanse of tree
tops; the mountain towered blue, abrupt, before
them. The stranger consulted a small map.
&#8220;This is Buck Mountain,&#8221; he announced rather than
queried; &#8220;Greenstream Village is beyond, west
from here, with the valley running north and south.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have got us laid out right,&#8221; Gordon assented;
&#8220;this all&#8217;s not new to you.&#8221; It was as close
to the direct question as Gordon Makimmon could
bring himself. And, in the sequel, it proved the
wisdom of his creed; for, obviously, the other
avoided the implied query. &#8220;The Government
prints a good map,&#8221; he remarked, and turned his
shoulder squarely upon any prolongation of the conversation.</p>
<p>They were now at the summit of Buck Mountain,
but dense juniper thickets hid from them any extended
view. After a turn, over the washed, rocky
road, the Greenstream Valley lay outspread below.</p>
<p>The sun was lowering, and the shadow of the
western range swept down the great, somber, wooded
wall towering against an illimitable vault of rosy
light; the lengthening shadows of the groves of trees
on the lower slope fell into the dark, cool, emerald
cleft. It was scarcely three fields across the shorn,
cultivated space to the opposite, precipitous barrier;
between, the valley ran narrow and rich into a faint,
broken haze of peaks thinly blue on either hand.
And, held in the still green heart of that withdrawn,
hidden space, the village lay along its white highway.</p>
<p>The stage dropped with short, sharp rushes down
the winding road; the houses lost the toy-like aspect
of distance; cowbells clashed faintly; a dog&#8217;s
bark quivered, suspended in hushed space. The
stage passed the first, scattered houses, and was
speedily in the village: each dwelling had, behind a
white picket fence, a strip of sod and a tangle of
simple, gay flowers&mdash;scarlet, white, purple and yellow,
now coated with a fine, chalky, summer dust.
The dwellings were, for the most part, frame, with a
rare structure of brick under mansard slates green
with moss. The back yards were fenced from the
fields, on which hay had been cut and stood in high
ricks, now casting long, mauve shadows over the
close, brilliant green. The stage passed the white
board structure of the Methodist Church, and
stopped before the shallow portico of the post-office.</p>

<p>A small, familiar group awaited the arrival
of the mail; and from it several figures
detached themselves. The postmaster
stepped forward, and assisted Gordon in unfastening
the mailbags; a clerk from Valentine Simmons&#8217;
store, in shirtsleeves elaborately restrained by pink
bowed elastics, inquired for a package by express;
and Pompey Hollidew pushed impatiently forward,
apparently anxious for a speedy view of his daughter.
This laudable assumption was, however, immediately
upset by the absent nod he bestowed upon
Lettice, and the evident interest and relief with
which he turned to the stranger descending from the
stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Hollidew?&#8221; the latter inquired, with ill-concealed
surprise.</p>
<p>Pompey Hollidew, the richest man in Greenstream,
wore&mdash;as was customary with him&mdash;a
crumpled yellow shirt, open at his stringy throat,
and innocent of tie; his trousers, one time lavender,
had faded to a repulsive, colorless hue, and hung
frayed about cheap, heavy shoes fastened by copper
rivets. An ancient cutaway of broadcloth, spotted
and greenish, with an incomplete mustering of buttons,
drooped about his heavy, bowed shoulders;
while a weather-beaten derby, seemingly unbrushed
for countless, grimy years, completed his forlorn
adornment.</p>
<p>His face was long, with vertical, pallid folds
gathered loosely into a chin frosted with unkempt
silver; his mouth was lipless, close, shadowed by an
overhanging, swollen nose; and, from beneath deep,
troubled brows, pale blue eyes set close together regarded
life skeptically, intently, with appalling
avidity, veiled yet discernible.</p>
<p>He disappeared, clutching the stranger&#8217;s sleeve,
with an effort at geniality. Simmons&#8217; clerk ruefully
tested the weight of a small, heavily nailed
box.</p>
<p>Lettice Hollidew slowly assembled her traveling
effects. It was evident that she wished to say something
to Gordon, for she lingered, patently playing
with her gloves, directing at him bright, nervous
glances from under the straw brim of her hat. But
she was forced to depart in silence, for Buckley Simmons,
in reply to the queries of the cause of his accident,
launched upon a loud, angry explanation of
the obvious aspect of the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;The clumsy yap!&#8221; he pointedly exclaimed.</p>
<p>Gordon entered the group of which Buckley was
the hub. &#8220;It was too bad to spoil Buck for the
girls,&#8221; he pronounced coolly; &#8220;but he&#8217;ll be after them
again in a couple of weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gazed with level disdain into the tempest gathering
in Simmons&#8217; eyes above the dark, spotted
handkerchief. He paused, deliberately insolent,
challenging a rejoinder, until, none breaking the
strained silence, he swung about, and, at the horses&#8217;
heads, led them to their stabling at Peterman&#8217;s Hotel.
He passed the unpainted, wooden front of the office
of the <i>Greenstream Bugle</i>; the house of Senator
Themeny in its lindens on a spreading lawn; on the
opposite side the mellow brick face of the Courthouse
under towering poplars, and Valentine Simmons&#8217;
store.</p>
<p>Gordon stopped at the latter on his way home.
It was a long, shedlike structure with a false façade;
before it, elevated a man&#8217;s height from the road,
was the broad platform where the mountain wagons
unloaded their merchandise; on the side facing the
Courthouse ran a wooden hitching rail. Inside, on
the left, Simmons&#8217; private office was shut in glass
from the main floor of the store; long counters led
back into a semi-obscurity, where a clerk was lighting
a row of swinging kerosene lamps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chalk them up, Sampson,&#8221; Gordon carelessly
told the clerk who wrapped up his purchases.
&#8220;How much are those?&#8221; he added, indicating a pair
of women&#8217;s low white shoes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Four. They&#8217;re real buck, and a topnotch article.
Nothing better comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon turned them over in his hand; they would,
he thought, just fit Clare; she liked pretty articles of
attire; she had not been so well lately. Clare was a
faithful sister. &#8220;Just add them to the bundle,&#8221; he
directed in a lordly manner.</p>
<p>The clerk hesitated, and glanced toward the private
office, where Simmons&#8217; head could be seen
pinkly bald. &#8220;Do you think you&#8217;d better, Gordon?&#8221;
he asked; &#8220;the boss has been crabbed lately
about some of the old accounts, and yours has waited
as long as any. I wouldn&#8217;t get nothing to catch his
eye&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Add the shoes to my bundle,&#8221; Gordon repeated
with a narrowing gaze; &#8220;I always ask for the advice
I need.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside he endeavored to recall when he had last
paid anything on his account at Simmons&#8217; store.
This was the last week in June&nbsp;...&nbsp;had he paid
any in April? in November? He was not able to
remember the occasion of his last settlement. He
must attend to that; he had other obligations, too,
small but long overdue. He cursed the fluid quality
of his wage, forever flowing through his fingers.
He must apportion his expenditures more carefully;
or, better yet, give all his money to Clare; the high-power
rifle he had purchased in Stenton the year
before had crippled their resources; his last Christmas
present to Clare had been a heavy drain; he had
not yet recovered from the generous funeral he had
given their mother.</p>
<p>He was unaccustomed to such considerations.
They interfered with the large view he held of himself,
of his importance, his deserts; they limited his
necessity for a natural indifference to penny matters;
and he dismissed them with an uneasy movement of
his shoulders.</p>
<p>He passed the discolored, plaster bulk of the Presbyterian
Church, the drug store and dwelling of Dr.
Pelliter, and was on the outskirts of the village.
The shadow of the western range had now slipped
across the valley and nearly climbed the opposite
wall; lavender scarfs of mist veiled the far, jumbled
peaks in the darkling rift; slim, swaying columns
of smoke from the clustered chimneys of
Greenstream towered dizzily through the shaded
air to where, high above, they were transformed to
gold by the last, up-flung rays of the sun.</p>

</div>

<p>A smooth, conical hill rose sharply to the
left, momentarily shutting out the valley;
and beyond, at the foot of a steep declivity,
stood the Makimmon dwelling. Originally a four-square,
log house, the logs had been covered by
boards, and to its present, irregular length, one room
in width, had been added an uneven roofed porch
broadside on a narrow lip of sod by a wide, shallow
stream. An indifferent stand of corn held precariously
to the sharp slope from the public road; an
unkempt cow grazed the dank sod by a primitive
well sweep; a heap of tin cans, bright or rusted, their
fading paper labels loose and littering the grass, had
been untidily accumulated at a back door.</p>
<p>Gordon passed about the end of his dwelling to
the side that faced the water. A wave of hot air, a
heavy, greasy odor and the sputtering of boiling
fat, swept out from the kitchen. He filled a tin
basin on the porch from a convenient bucket of
water, and made a hasty toilet.</p>
<p>Clare paused at the door, a long handled spoon
in her attenuated grasp; she was an emaciated
woman of thirty, with prominent cheek bones, a
thin, sensitive nose, and a colorless mouth set in a
harsh line by excessive physical suffering. There
was about her, in spite of her gaunt features and
narrow, stooping frame, something appealingly simple,
girlish. A blue ribband made a gay note in her
faded, scant hair; she had pinned a piece of draggled
color about her throat. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been looking
for you the half hour,&#8221; she said querulously; &#8220;draw
up t&#8217; the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I stopped at Simmons&#8217;, and brought you a pretty,
too; it&#8217;s in the bundle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gordon!&#8221; she exclaimed, as he unwrapped the
shoes, &#8220;they are elegant! Had you ought to have
got them? We need so much&mdash;mosquito bar, the
flies are terrible wearing, the roof&#8217;s crying for tin,
and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re as bad as Sampson,&#8221; he interrupted her,
almost shortly; &#8220;we&#8217;ve got to have pleasures as
well as profits. And too,&#8221; he directed, &#8220;don&#8217;t put
those shoes away like you did that watered silk
shawl I got you in Stenton. Wear them&nbsp;...&nbsp;to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;not just setting around;
they&#8217;ll get smudged. Not to-night, Gordon; maybe
to-morrow, or when I go to church.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tonight,&#8221; he repeated inexorably.</p>
<p>A bare, stained table with spreading legs pinned
through the oak board was ranged against a bench
on the kitchen wall, where, in the watery light of a
small, glass lamp, Gordon and Clare Makimmon ate
their supper of flat, dark, salt-raised bread, strips of
bacon and dripping greens, and swimming, purplish
preserves.</p>
<p>After supper they sat on the narrow porch, facing
the dark, whispering stream, the night pouring into
the deep, still valley. A cold air rose from the surface
of the water, and Clare wrapped a worn piece
of blanket about her shoulders. At frequent intervals
she gazed with palpable delight at her feet,
shod in the &#8220;real buck.&#8221; A deep, melancholy
chorus of frogs rose from the creek, mingling with
the high, metallic shrilling of crickets, the reiterated
calling of whippoorwills from a thicket of pines.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon settled into a waking somnolence,
lulled by the familiar, profound, withdrawn
repose of the valley. He could distinguish Clare&#8217;s
form weaving back and forth in a low rocker; the
moonless, summer night embraced, hid, all; there
were no lights in the house at his back, no lights visible
in the village beyond; only the impenetrable
blackness of the opposite range and the abrupt band
of stars.</p>
<p>Suddenly Clare&#8217;s even breathing, the tracking
sound of the chair, ceased; she drew two or three
sharp, gasping inspirations. Gordon, instantly
alert, rose and stood over her. &#8220;Is it bad to-night
again?&#8221; he asked solicitously; &#8220;shall I get you the
ginger water?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None&nbsp;...&nbsp;in the house,&#8221; she articulated laboriously;
&#8220;pretty&nbsp;...&nbsp;bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t leave me; just set; I&#8217;ll be better in a
spell.&#8221; He fetched her a glass of water, from
which she gulped spasmodically, clutching with
cold, wet fingers to his wrist. Then the tension relaxed,
her breathing grew more normal. &#8220;It&#8217;s by
now,&#8221; she proclaimed unsteadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back the road for a little ginger,&#8221; he
told her from the edge of the porch; &#8220;we&#8217;d best
have the bottle filled.&#8221;</p>
<p>The drug store was dark, closed for the night, and
Gordon continued to Simmons&#8217; store. The row of
swinging, kerosene lamps cast a thick yellow radiance
over the long counters, the variously laden
shelves. The store was filled with the odor of coffee,
the penetrating smell of print muslins.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Simmons wants you a minute in the office,&#8221;
the clerk responded indirectly to his request for ginger.
Gordon instinctively masked a gathering
premonition of trouble. &#8220;Fill her up the while,&#8221; he
demanded, pushing forward the empty bottle.</p>
<p>Valentine Simmons was a small man with a
pinkly bald head ornamented with fluffs of white
hair like cotton wool above his ears, and precise,
shaven lips forever awry in the pronouncing of rallying
or benevolent sentences; these, with appropriate
religious sentiments, formed nine-tenths of his discourse,
through which the rare words that revealed
his purposes, his desires, flashed like slender and
ruthless knives.</p>
<p>He was bending over a tall, narrow ledger when
Gordon entered the office; but he immediately closed
the book and swung about in his chair. The small
enclosure was hot, and filled with the odor of scorching
metal, the buzzing of a large, blundering fly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Valentine Simmons exclaimed pleasantly;
&#8220;our link with the outer world, our faithful messenger....
I wanted to see you; ah, yes.&#8221; He
turned over the pages of a second, heavier ledger
at his hand. &#8220;Here it is&mdash;Gordon Makimmon,
good Scotch Presbyterian name. Five hundred and
thirty dollars,&#8221; he said suddenly, unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Gordon was unable to credit his senses, the fact
that this was the sum of his indebtedness; it was an
absurd mistake, and he said so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything listed against its date,&#8221; the other returned
imperturbably, &#8220;down to a pair of white buck
shoes for a lady to-day&mdash;a generous present for some
enslaver.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My sister,&#8221; Gordon muttered ineptly. Five
hundred and thirty dollars, he repeated incredulously
to himself. Five hundred.... &#8220;How long
has it been standing?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>The other consulted the book. &#8220;Two years, a
month and four days,&#8221; he returned exactly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But no notice was served on me; nothing was
said about my bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, we don&#8217;t like to annoy old friends; just a
little word at necessary intervals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Old rumors, stories, came to Gordon&#8217;s memory
in regard to the long credit extended by Simmons to
&#8220;old friends,&#8221; the absence of any rendered accounts;
and, in that connection, the thought of the
number of homesteads throughout the county that
had come, through forced sales, into the storekeeper&#8217;s
hands. The circumstantial details of these
events had been bitten by impassioned oaths into
his mind, together with the memory of the dreary
ruin that had settled upon the evicted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can give you something day after to-morrow,
when I am paid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Entirely satisfactory; three hundred&mdash;no, for
you two hundred and fifty dollars will be sufficient;
the rest another time&nbsp;...&nbsp;whenever you are able.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I get two dollars and fifty cents a day,&#8221; Gordon
reminded him, with a dry and bitter humor, &#8220;and I
have a month&#8217;s pay coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Valentine Simmons had not, apparently, heard
him. &#8220;Two hundred and fifty only,&#8221; he repeated;
&#8220;we always like to accommodate old friends, especially
Presbyterian friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can give you fifty dollars,&#8221; Gordon told him,
at once loud and conciliatory; wondering, at the
same time, how, if he did, Clare and himself would
manage. He had to pay for his board in Stenton;
the doctor for Clare had to be met&mdash;fifty cents in
hand a visit, or the visits ceased.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have your little joke, then get out that hidden
stocking, pry up that particular fire brick&nbsp;...&nbsp;only
two hundred and fifty now&nbsp;...&nbsp;but&mdash;now.&#8221;</p>
<p>A hopeless feeling of impotence enveloped Gordon:
the small, dry man before him with the pink,
bald head shining in the lamplight, the set grin, was
as remote from any appeal as an insensate figure
cast in metal, a painted iron man in neat, grey alpaca,
a stiff, white shirt with a small blue button and
an exact, prim muslin bow.</p>
<p>Still, &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you fifty, and thirty the next
month. Why, damn it, I&#8217;ll pay you off in the year.
I&#8217;m not going to run away. I have steady work;
you know what I am getting; you&#8217;re safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Valentine Simmons lifted a hand in a
round, glistening cuff, &#8220;is anything certain in this
human vale? Is anything secure that might hang
on the swing of a&nbsp;...&nbsp;whip?&#8221;</p>
<p>With an unaccustomed, violent effort of will Gordon
Makimmon suppressed his angry concern at the
other&#8217;s covert allusion: outside his occupation as
stage driver he was totally without resources, without
the ability to pay for a bag of Green Goose
tobacco. The Makimmons had never been thrifty&nbsp;...&nbsp;in
the beginning they had let their wide share
of valley holding grow deep in thicket, where they
might hunt the deer, their streams course through
a woven wild where pheasant might feed and fall
to their accurate guns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two hundred and fifty dollars,&#8221; Valentine Simmons
repeated pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got it, and can&#8217;t get it, all at once,&#8221;
Gordon reiterated in a conciliatory manner. Then
his straining, chafing pride, his assaulted self-esteem,
overflowed a little his caution. &#8220;And you
know it,&#8221; he declared in a loud, ugly voice; &#8220;you
know the size of every pocketbook in Greenstream;
I&#8217;ll bet, by God, you and old man Hollidew know
personal every copper Indian on the pennies of the
County.&#8221;</p>
<p>Valentine Simmons smiled at this conception.
Gordon regarded him with hopeless, growing anger:
Why, the old screw took that for a compliment!</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Wednesday,&#8221; the storekeeper pronounced;
&#8220;say, by Saturday&nbsp;...&nbsp;the sum I mentioned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be done.&#8221; The last vestiges of Gordon&#8217;s
control were fast melting in the heat of his
passion. Simmons turned to the narrow ledger,
picking up a pen. &#8220;When you bought,&#8221; he
remarked precisely, over his shoulders, &#8220;the white
shoes and ammunition and silk fishing lines&mdash;didn&#8217;t
you intend to pay for them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did, and will. And when you said,
&#8216;Gordon, help yourself, load up, try those flies&#8217;;
and &#8216;Never mind the bill now, some other time, old
friends pay when they please,&#8217; didn&#8217;t you know I
was getting in over my head? didn&#8217;t you encourage
it&nbsp;...&nbsp;so you could get judgment on me? sell me
out? Though what you settled on me for, what you
see in my ramshackle house and used up ground, is
over me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Simmons flashed a momentary, crafty glance at
the other. &#8220;Never overlook a location on good
water,&#8221; he advised.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon stood speechless, trembling
with rage. For a moment Simmons&#8217; pen, scratching
over the page, made the only sound in the small
enclosure, then, &#8220;The provident man,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;is always made a target for the abuse of the&mdash;the
thoughtless. But he usually comes to the
assistance of his unfortunate brother. You might
arrange a loan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, so I might,&#8221; Gordon assented in a thick
voice; &#8220;I could get it from your provident friend,
Hollidew&mdash;three hundred dollars, say, at hell&#8217;s per
cent; a little lien on my property. &#8216;Never overlook
a situation on good water.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;By God!&#8221; he exclaimed, suddenly prescient,
&#8220;but I&#8217;ve done for myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he thought of Clare, of Clare fighting
eternally that sharp pain in her side, her face now
drawn and glistening with the sweat of suffering,
now girlishly gay. He thought of her fragile hands
so impotent to cope with the bitter poverty of the
mountains. What, with their home, her place of
retreat and security, gone, and&mdash;it now appeared
more than probable&mdash;his occupation vanished,
would she do?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done for myself, for her,&#8221; he repeated, subconsciously
aloud, in a harsh whisper. He stood
rigid, unseeing; a pulse beat visibly in the brown
throat by the collarless and faded shirt. Simmons
regarded him with a covert gaze, then, catching the
attention of the clerk in the store outside, beckoned
slightly with his head. The clerk approached, vigorously
brushing the counters with a turkey wing.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon&#8217;s gaze concentrated on the
storekeeper. &#8220;You&#8217;re almost an old man,&#8221; he said,
in a slow, unnatural voice; &#8220;you have been robbing
men and women of their homes for a great many
years, and you are still alive. It&#8217;s surprising that
some one has not killed you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been shot at,&#8221; Valentine Simmons replied;
&#8220;behind my back. The men who fail are like
that as a rule.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not like that,&#8221; Gordon informed him; &#8220;it&#8217;s
pretty well known that I stand square in front of the
man I&#8217;m after. Don&#8217;t you think, this time, you
have made a little mistake? Hadn&#8217;t I better give
you that fifty, and something more later?&#8221;</p>
<p>Valentine Simmons rose from his chair and
turned, facing Gordon. His muslin bow had
slipped awry on the polished, immaculate bosom
of his shirt, and it gave him a slightly ridiculous,
birdlike expression. He gazed coldly, with his thin
lips firm and hands still, into the other&#8217;s threatening,
virulent countenance. &#8220;Two hundred and fifty
dollars,&#8221; he insisted.</p>
<p>The thought of Clare, betrayed, persisted in Gordon&#8217;s
mind, battling with his surging temper, his unreasoning
resentment. Valentine Simmons stood
upright, still, against the lamplight. It was plain
that he was not to be intimidated. An overwhelming
wave of misery, a dim realization of the disastrous
possibilities of his folly, inundated Gordon,
drowning all other considerations. He turned, and
walked abruptly from the office into the store.
There the clerk placed on the counter the bottle,
filled and wrapped. In a petty gust of rage, like a
jet of steam escaping from a defective boiler, he
swept the bottle to the floor, where he ground the
splintering fragments of glass, the torn and stained
paper, into an untidy blot.</p>

<p>Outside, the village, the Greenstream Valley,
was folded in still, velvety dark. He
crossed the street, and sat on one of the
iron benches placed under the trees on the Courthouse
lawn. He could see a dull, reddish light
shining through the dusty window of the <i>Bugle</i> office.
Shining like that, through his egotistical
pride, the facts of his failure and impotence tormented
him. It hurt him the more that he had been,
simply, diddled, no better than a child in Simmons&#8217;
astute, practised hands. The latter&#8217;s rascality was
patent, but Simmons could not have been successful
unabetted by his own blind negligence. The catastrophe
that had overtaken him rankled in his most
vulnerable spot&mdash;his self-esteem.</p>
<p>He suffered inarticulately, an indistinguishable
shape in the soft, summer gloom; about his feet, in
the lush grass, the greenish-gold sparks of the fireflies
quivered; above the deep rift of the valley the
stars were like polished silver coins.</p>
<p>Vaguely, and then more strongly, out of a chaos
of vain, sick regrets, his combativeness, his
deep-lying, indomitable determination, asserted itself&mdash;he
would not fall like an over ripe apple into Simmons&#8217;
complacent, waiting grasp. But to get, without
resources, two hundred and fifty dollars by Saturday,
was a preposterous task. Outside his,
Clare&#8217;s, home, he had nothing to sell; and to sell
that now, he realized with a spoken oath, would be
to throw it away&mdash;the vultures, Hollidew and Co.,
would have heard of his necessity, and regulate their
action, the local supply of available currency, accordingly.</p>
<p>There was no possible way of earning such a sum
in four days; there was little more chance, he realized
sardonically, of stealing it.... Sometimes
large sums of money were won in a night&#8217;s gambling
in the lumber and mining towns over the West Virginia
line. But, for that, he would require capital;
he would have his wages to-morrow; however, if
he gambled with that and lost, Clare and himself
would face immediate, irredeemable ruin. He dismissed
that consideration from the range of possibilities.
But it returned, hovered on the border of
his thoughts&mdash;he might risk a part of his capital,
say thirty dollars. If he lost that they would be
little worse off than they were at present; while if he
won&nbsp;...&nbsp;he might easily win.</p>
<p>He mentally arranged the details, assuring himself,
the while, that he was only toying with the
idea.&mdash;He would pay the customary substitute to
drive the stage to Stenton, and cross Cheap Mountain
on foot; by dark he would be in Sprucesap, play
that night, and return the following day, Friday.</p>
<p>With an effort he still put the scheme from his
thoughts; but, while he kept it in abeyance, nothing
further occurred to him. That gave him a possible
reprieve; all else offered sure disaster. He rose,
and walked slowly toward his home, revolving, testing,
the various aspects of the trip to Sprucesap; at
once deciding upon that venture, and repeating to
himself the incontestable fact of its utter folly.</p>
<p>The dark was intense, blue-black, about his dwelling.
He struck a match at the edge of the porch,
a pointed, orange exclamation on the impenetrable
gloom. Clare, weary of waiting, had gone to bed;
her door was shut, her window tightly closed. The
invisible stream gurgled sadly past its banks, the
whippoorwills throbbed with ceaseless, insistent passion.</p>
<p>A sudden, jumbled vision of the past woven about
this dwelling, his home, wheeled through Gordon&#8217;s
mind, scenes happy and unhappy; prevailing want
and slim, momentary plenty; his father dead, in his
coffin with a stony, pinched countenance, a jaw still
unrelaxed above the bright flag that draped his nondescript
uniform. Later events followed&mdash;his
elder, vanished brother bullying him; the brief
romance of his sister&#8217;s courtship; the high, strident
voice of his mother, that had always reminded him
of her angry red nose&mdash;events familiar, sordid, unlovely,
but now they seemed all of a piece of desirable,
melancholy happiness; they endowed with a
hitherto unsuspected value every board of the rough
footing of the Makimmon dwelling, every rood of
the poor, rocky soil, the weedy grass. He said
aloud, in a subdued, jarring voice, &#8220;By God, but
Simmons won&#8217;t get it!&#8221; But the dreary whippoorwills,
the feverish crickets, offered him no confirmation,
no assurance.</p>

</div>

<p>At noon, on the day following, he stood on
the top of Cheap Mountain, gazing back
into the deep, verdant cleft of Greenstream.
From Cheap the reason for its name was clear&mdash;it
flowed now direct, now turning, in a vivid green
stream along the bases of its mountainous ranges; it
flowed tranquil and dark and smooth between banks
of tangled saplings, matted, multifarious underbrush,
towering, venerable trees. It slipped like a
river, bearing upon its balmy surface the promise of
asylum, of sleep, of plenty, through the primitive,
ruthless forest, which in turn pressed upon it everywhere
the menace of its oblivion, its fierce, strangling
life.</p>
<p>He saw below him stretches of the steep, rocky
trail by which he had mounted with the mounting
sun; both had now reached the zenith of their day&#8217;s
journey; from there he would sink into the shadow,
the secretiveness, of night.... Greenstream village
lay twenty-eight miles behind; it was seventeen
more to Sprucesap: he hurried forward.</p>
<p>In his pocket rested not the thirty dollars, to which
he had limited himself in thought, but his entire
month&#8217;s salary,&mdash;he might lose all by the lack of a
paltry dollar or so.</p>
<p>He was dressed with more care than on the day
previous: he wore a dark suit, the coat to which now
swung on a stick over his shoulder, a rubber collar,
a tie of orange brocade erected on a superstructure
of cardboard; his head was covered by a hard, black
felt hat, pushed back from his sweating brow, and
his trousers hung from a pair of obviously home-knitted,
yarn suspenders. He shifted the stick from
right to left. His revolver dragged chafing against
a leg, and he removed it and thrust it into a pocket
of the coat.</p>
<p>He followed by turn an old rutted postroad and
faint, forest trails, and shortened distances by breaking
through the trackless underbrush, watching subconsciously
for rattlesnakes. The sun slowly declined,
its rays fell diagonally, lengthening, through
the trees; in a glade the air seemed filled with gold
dust; the sky burned in a single flame of apricot.
The air, rather than grow dark, appeared to thicken
with raw color, with mauve and ultramarine, silver
and cinnabar.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the little, deeply-grassed plain
that held Sprucesap, it was bathed in a flaring after-glow,
a magical, floating light. A double row of
board structures faced each other across a street of
raw clay and narrow, wood sidewalks; they were,
for the most part, unpainted, hasty erections of a
single story. A building labelled the Steel Spud
Hotel was more pretentious. The others were eating
houses, stores with small windows filled with a
threatening miscellany&mdash;revolvers, leather slung
shots and brass knuckles, besides lumbering boots,
gaudy Mackinaw jackets, gleaming knives and ammunition.
Beyond the street a single car track ran
precariously over the green, and ended abruptly,
without roadbed or visible terminus; at one side was
a rude platform, on the other a great pile of bark,
rotting from long exposure&mdash;the result of some artificial
condition of the market, the spite of powerful
and vindictive merchants.</p>
<p>A second hotel stood alone, beyond the car tracks,
and there Gordon removed the marks of his journey,
resettled his collar and the resplendent tie. He felt
in his coat for the revolver, in order to transfer it
to a more convenient pocket.... Its bulk, apparently,
evaded his fingers. His search quickened&mdash;it
had gone! He had lost it somewhere on his long,
devious passage of Cheap Mountain. Without it
he would be in the power of any spindling gambler
who faced a dishonest ace. It would be necessary
to procure another weapon before proceeding with
his purpose&nbsp;...&nbsp;ten dollars, perhaps fifteen; revolvers
were highly priced in the turbulent distant
wild. Could he afford to lose that amount from his
slender store of dollars? Intact it was absurdly inadequate.
He debated the choice&mdash;on one hand
the peril of gambling unarmed, on the other his desperate
need for money. Once more he considered
Clare: in the end his arrogance of manhood brought
a decision&mdash;he would preserve the money for play.
He was, he thought insolently of himself, quick as a
copperhead snake, and as dangerous. After supper
he sat on the porch, twisting and consuming cigarettes,
waiting for the night.</p>

<p>Large kerosene lamps dilated by tin reflectors
lit the front of the Steel Spud. In
their radiance he saw the gaily-attired form
of a woman. She wore a white hat, with a sweeping,
white ostrich plume, which hid her face with
the exception of a retreating chin and prominent,
carmine lips; while a fat, unwieldy body was covered
by a waist of Scotch plaid silk&mdash;lines and
squares of black and primary colors&mdash;and a short,
scant skirt of blue broadcloth that, drawn up by her
knees, exposed small feet in white kid and heavy
ankles.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon paused, and she leaned forward
to meet his challenging gaze. &#8220;Just in from
camp?&#8221; she inquired, in a voice hoarse, repellent,
conciliatory, and with a mechanical grimace which
he identified as a smile. He stopped at the invitation
in her tones, and nodded. &#8220;And looking for a
good time,&#8221; he further informed her; &#8220;perhaps a little
game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop right where you are,&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve found them both.&#8221; He mounted to the
porch, and shook her extended hand, cushioned with
fat, and oddly damp and lifeless. He could see her
countenance now&mdash;it was plaster white with insignificant
features and rose like an amorphous column
from a swollen throat, a nose like a dab of putty,
eyes obscured by drooping, pouchy lids, leaden-hued.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing you seen me,&#8221; she told him, endeavoring
to establish a relationship of easy confidence,
&#8220;instead of them diseased Mags down the
street. Shall we have a little drink upstairs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s early,&#8221; he negligently interposed; &#8220;how
about a turn of the cards first? Do you know any one
who would take a hand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got my friend here, and there&#8217;s a gentleman
at the hotel would accommodate us. They&#8217;re inside.&#8221;
She rose, and moved toward the door, waving
him to follow. Her slow, clumsy body and
chinless, full-lidded head reminded him of a turtle;
she gave a still deeper amphibious impression&mdash;there
was something markedly cold-blooded, inhuman,
deleted, in her incongruous, gaudy bulk&mdash;an
impression of a low, primitive organism, the subtle
smell of primal mud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jake!&#8221; she called at the entrance to the crude
hotel office; &#8220;Jake! Mr. Ottinger! here&#8217;s a gentleman
wants a little game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two men hastily rose and advanced toward the
door. The first, Jake, was small, with the narrow,
high shoulders, the long, pale face, the long, pale
hands, of a cripple. The other, a young man with
a sodden countenance discolored by old purplish
bruises, wore a misfitting suit that drew across
heavy, bowed shoulders, thick, powerful arms. He
regarded Gordon Makimmon with no light dawning
upon his lowering face; no greeting disturbed the
dark, hard line of his mouth. But the other, with
an apparently hearty, stereotyped flow of words, applauded
Gordon&#8217;s design, approved his qualities of
sportsmanship, courage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me the man from the woods for an open-handed
sport,&#8221; he vociferated; &#8220;he ain&#8217;t a fool
neither, he&#8217;s wise to the time of night. The city
crowd, the wise ones, are the real ringside marks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come up to my room,&#8221; the woman directed from
the foot of a stairway; &#8220;where no amateur John
Condons will tell us how to play our cards. I got
some good liquor, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>In her room she lit a small lamp, which proved
insufficient, and Mr. Ottinger brought a second from
his quarters. Gordon found himself in a long, narrow
chamber furnished with two wooden beds, two
identical, insecure bureaus, stands with wash basins
and pitchers, and a table. The floor, the walls, the
ceiling, were resinous yellow pine, and gave out a
hot, dry smell from which there was no escape but
the door, for the room was without other outlet.</p>
<p>A preliminary drink was indispensable; and,
served in two glasses and a cracked toothbrush mug&mdash;Mr.
Ottinger elected to imbibe his &#8220;straight&#8221;
from the bottle&mdash;it was drunk with mutual assurances
of tender regard. &#8220;Happy days,&#8221; the woman
pronounced. Only three chairs were available, and
after some shuffling, appropriate references to &#8220;honest
and plain&#8221; country accommodations, the table
was ranged by a bed on which Em&mdash;&#8220;Call me Em,&#8221;
she had invited Gordon, &#8220;let&#8217;s be real homelike,&#8221;&mdash;seated
herself.</p>
<p>The smaller man ostentatiously broke the seal
from a new pack of cards, dexterously spreading
them across the table. His hands, Gordon saw,
were extraordinarily supple, and emanated a sickly
odor of glycerine. His companion&#8217;s were huge and
misshapen, but they, too, were surprisingly deft,
quick.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll it be?&#8221; Jake demanded; &#8220;Jackpots;
stud; straight draw&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell, let&#8217;s throw cold hands,&#8221; Mr. Ottinger interrupted,
&#8220;chop the trimmings. We&#8217;re here for
the stuff, ain&#8217;t we?&#8221; He was immediately reprehended
for his brusque, unsociable manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got the idea, though,&#8221; Gordon approved;
&#8220;we&#8217;re here for the stuff.&#8221; It was finally arranged
that poker hands should be dealt, a draw allowed,
and the cards shown, the highest cards to take the
visible money. &#8220;A dollar a go?&#8221; Jake queried,
cutting for the deal. On the bed by the woman&#8217;s
side was a tarnished, silver bag, with an ornate,
meretricious clasp; her two companions produced
casual rolls of paper money; and Gordon detached
five dollars from the slender amount of his wage,
his paramount capital. On a washstand, within
easy reach, stood the bottle of whisky flanked by the
motley array of drinking vessels.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon&#8217;s five dollars vanished in as
many minutes. Oppressed by consuming anxiety
he could scarcely breathe in the close, stale air. Em
gambled with an affectation of careless indifference;
she asked in an off-hand manner for cards; paid
her losses with a loud laugh. Jake invariably gave
one rapid glance at his hand, and then threw it
down upon the table without separating his discard.
Mr. Ottinger, it was plain, was superstitious&mdash;he
edged his hand open by imperceptible degrees until
the denominations of the cards were visible, then
hurriedly closed them from sight; often he didn&#8217;t
look at his draw until all the hands were exposed.
He wrinkled his face in painful efforts of concentration,
protruded a thick and unsavory tongue. At
the loose corners of Jake&#8217;s mouth flecks of saliva
gathered whitely; in the fleering light of the kerosene
the shadows on his face were cobalt. The woman&#8217;s
face shone with drops of perspiration that formed
slowly and rolled like a flash over her plastered
skin.</p>
<p>Another round of drinks was negotiated, adding
to the fiery discomfort of the sealed room, of the
dry, dead atmosphere. Gordon won back his five
dollars, and gained five more. &#8220;Let&#8217;s make it two
a throw,&#8221; the woman proposed. The thickset,
young man remuttered the period that they were
there for the stuff. &#8220;Otty will have his little joke,&#8221;
she proclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not funny,&#8221; he protested seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two?&#8221; Jake demanded of Gordon. The latter
nodded.</p>

</div>

<p>Late in the night they were still playing
without a change in their positions. Em
still perspired; but Mr. Ottinger no longer
protruded his tongue, a sullen anger was evident in
his every move; Jake&#8217;s affable flow of conversation
was hushed; Gordon&#8217;s face set. It was, indisputably,
not funny&mdash;he had won nearly two hundred
dollars. &#8220;Make it ten?&#8221; Jake queried. The others
nodded. Now Gordon had two hundred and twenty
dollars; an extraordinary, overwhelming luck presided
over his cards, he won more frequently than
the other three together. A tense silence enveloped
the latter: they shuffled, demanded cards, threw
down their hands, in a hurried, disorganized fashion.
They glanced, each at the other, swiftly; it
was evident that a common idea, other than the
game, possessed them. Jake hovered a breath
longer than necessary over the bottle, then pressed
a drink upon Gordon. He refused; this, he recognized,
was not a time for dissipation; he needed
every faculty.</p>
<p>Two hundred and sixty dollars. The air of suppression,
of tension, increased. Gordon&#8217;s only
concern now was to get away, to take the money with
him.</p>
<p>Em shuffled in a slipshod, inattentive manner;
Mr. Ottinger opened his hand boldly, faced his bad
luck with a stony eye; Jake labored under a painful
excitement, obviously not connected with his losses;
his long, waxy fingers quivered, a feverish point
of fire flickered in either cadaverous cheek; his eyes
glowed between hollow, sunken temples. &#8220;Four,&#8221;
he demanded, with shaking lips. Mr. Ottinger
rapped out a request for one. &#8220;I&#8217;m satisfied,&#8221; Gordon
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t that sucker beat hell!&#8221; Em declared, the
solicitous manner that, earlier in the evening, had
marked her manner toward Gordon, carelessly discarded.
&#8220;I&#8217;m taking three.&#8221; A sudden, visible
boredom fell upon her as she glanced at her filled
hand. &#8220;Leave us double it,&#8221; she remarked. Gordon
nodded, and she threw her hand upon the table;
it held four nines. She reached her fat, chalky arm
toward the money, but Gordon was before her.
&#8220;Four queens,&#8221; he shot out, grasping the crumpled
bills.</p>
<p>Em cursed; then followed a short, awkward silence.
It was Ottinger&#8217;s deal, but he did not pick
up the scattered cards. Gordon gathered himself
alertly, measuring the distance to the door. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got enough,&#8221; he remarked; &#8220;I&#8217;m going to quit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You got enough, all right,&#8221; Em agreed. &#8220;Now,
how&#8217;d you like to have a real good time?&#8221; She disposed
herself upon her elbow, so that the sagging
bulk of her body was emphasized through its straining
apparel; one leg, incredible, leviathan, was
largely visible.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough,&#8221; Gordon repeated; &#8220;I&#8217;ll be
moving.&#8221;</p>
<p>Em rose quickly, losing her air of coquetry.
Gordon was facing the men, and was unprepared for
the heavy blow she dealt upon the back of his neck.
&#8220;Hang it on him, Otty!&#8221; she cried excitedly.</p>
<p>Mr. Ottinger shoved the card table from his path.
It was now evident that it was, precisely, to &#8220;hang
it on&#8221; whoever might be elected for that delicate
attention which formed Otty&#8217;s purpose, profession,
preoccupation, in life. He was, for a heavy man,
active; and, before Gordon Makimmon could put
out a protective arm, he returned the latter to the
perpendicular with a jarring blow on the chin.
Jake whipped out from a place of concealment on
his person a plaited leather weapon with a globular
end.</p>
<p>It was Jake, Gordon instinctively knew, who
threatened him most; he could easily stop the hulking
shape before him. He regained his poise, and
returned blow for blow with Mr. Ottinger; neither
man guarded, both were solely intent upon marking,
crippling, the other. A chair fell, sliding across the
floor; a washstand collapsed with a splintering crash
of china, a miniature flood. Em stood on the outskirts
of the conflict, armed with the whisky bottle;
Jake crouched watchful with the leather club. Gordon
cut his opponent&#8217;s face with short, vicious jabs;
he was, as customary, cold&mdash;he saw clearly where
every blow fell; he saw Otty&#8217;s nose grotesquely
shapeless and blackened; he felt Otty&#8217;s teeth cut the
skin of his knuckles and break off; he heard his involuntary
gasp as he struck him a hammer-like blow
over the heart.</p>
<p>Mr. Ottinger, in return, hit him frequently and
with effect. Gordon was conscious of a warm,
gummy tide spreading over his face, he saw with
difficulty through rapidly closing eyes. &#8220;For Cri&#8217;s
sake,&#8221; Otty gasped, &#8220;get to him, the town&#8217;ll be on
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Em made an ineffectual lunge with the bottle.
Gordon swung the point of his elbow into her side,
and she sat on the bed with a &#8220;G-G-God!&#8221; Jake
hit him with the club on the shoulder blade; numbness
radiated from the struck point; there was a loss
of power in the corresponding arm. Jake hit him
again, and a stabbing pain entered his side and
stayed apparently tangled in splintered bone. He
paused for a moment, and all three fell upon him,
beating, clubbing, kicking. He fought on, now
rapidly losing power. The woman threw herself on
his back, forced him to his knees. &#8220;Won&#8217;t none of
you do for him?&#8221; she complained hysterically. She
pressed his head into her breast, and Mr. Ottinger
hit him below and just back of his ear. Gordon
slipped out full length on the floor.</p>
<p>He was waveringly conscious, but he had lost all
interest, all sense of personal connection, with the
proceedings. He dully watched Ottinger draw
back, tenderly fingering his damaged features; he
saw Em breathing stormily, empurpled. Jake, with
the crimson flames in his long, pallid mask, the
white saliva flecking his jaw, hung over him with a
glassy, intent stare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get the stuff,&#8221; the practical Ottinger urged;
&#8220;it&#8217;s the stuff we&#8217;re after. Don&#8217;t go bug again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jake don&#8217;t hear you,&#8221; Em told him, &#8220;he&#8217;s off.
I&#8217;m glad the fella&#8217;s going to be fixed, he jolted me
something fierce.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jake swung the little, flexuous club softly against
his palm, and Gordon suddenly realized that the
cripple intended to kill him.&mdash;That was the lust
which transfigured the gambler&#8217;s countenance, which
lit the fires in the deathly cheeks, set the long fingers
shaking. Gordon considered the idea, and, obscurely,
it troubled him, moved him a space from
his apathy. Instinctively, in response to a sudden
movement of the figure above him, he drew his arm
up in front of his head; and an intolerable pain shot
up through his shoulder and flared, blindingly, in
his eyes. It pierced his indifference, set in motion
his reason, his memory; he realized the necessity, the
danger, of his predicament&nbsp;...&nbsp;the money!&mdash;he
must guard it, take it back with him. Above, in a
heated, orange mist, the woman&#8217;s face loomed blank
and inhuman; farther back Mr. Ottinger&#8217;s features
were indistinctly visible.</p>
<p>He must rise....</p>
<p>His groping hand caught hold of the rung of
the chair, and, with herculean labor, he turned and
raised himself a fraction from the floor. Jake directed
a hasty blow at his head that missed him altogether.
His other hand caught the chair, and he
dragged himself dizzily into a kneeling posture. A
sudden change swept over the three above him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nail him where he is!&#8221; Em cried excitedly;
&#8220;he&#8217;s getting up on you.&#8221; Gordon&#8217;s hands moved
uncertainly upward on the chair; his knees rose from
the floor. A shower of blows fell on him; the
woman beat him with her pudgy fists; Mr. Ottinger
was kicking at him; Jake was weeping, and endeavoring
to get room in which to swing his club.</p>
<p>Gordon had one foot on the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me a chance at him,&#8221; Jake implored; &#8220;give
me a chance. God, if I had a knife.&#8221;</p>
<p>If they took away the chair, Gordon knew, he was
lost. He clung to it; pressed his breast against it;
crept upward by means of it, slowly, slowly, through
a storm of battering hands. It seemed to him that,
in rising, he was shouldering aside the entire weight,
the forces, of a universe, bent on his destruction, and
against which he was determined to prevail. It was
as though his will, the vitality which animated him,
which was his soul, stood aside from his beaten and
suffering body, and, with a cold, a cruel, detachment,
commanded it upright.</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s bulk got in Jake&#8217;s way, and he
struck her across the eyes with the back of his hand,
consigning her to eternal hell. Mr. Ottinger, confused
by the irregularity of the turmoil, worked inefficiently,
swinging at random his hard fists, kicking
impartially.</p>
<p>Gordon now had both feet upon the floor; he
straightened up. For a breath the three stood motionless,
livid; and in that instant his hand fell upon
the door knob, he staggered back into the hall, carrying
with him a vision of his brocaded tie lying
upon the floor.</p>

<p>He stumbled hastily down the stairway, and
found the narrow porch, the serene, enveloping
night; down the street lamps
made blots of brightness, but, beyond, the obscurity
was profound, unbroken. Wave after wave of
nausea swept over him, he clung to a porch support
with cold sweat starting through the blood that
smeared his countenance, stiffened in his shirt, that
was warm upon his side. The sound of footfalls,
sharp, repressed voices from above, stirred him into a
fresh realization of his precarious position. The
gamblers would follow him, rob him with impunity
in the shadows of Sprucesap&#8217;s lawless street, drag
him behind the angle of a building, where Jake
would have ample scope for the swinging of his
leathered lead....</p>
<p>He lurched down to the street, and silently merged
into the awaiting night.</p>
<p>At dawn he appeared from a thicket, a mile beyond
Sprucesap on the road to Greenstream, and
negotiated successfully a ride on a load of fragrant
upland hay to a point within a few miles of his
destination. His coat, soiled and torn, was buttoned
across a bare throat, for his shirt had been ripped
into bandages; his face, apparently, had been harrowed
for a red planting; he moved awkwardly,
breathed with a gasp from a stabbing pain in the
side&nbsp;...&nbsp;but he moved, breathed. He drank with
long delight from a sparkling spring. He had the
money, two hundred and eighty dollars, safely in his
pocket.</p>

<p>The afternoon was waning when he gazed
again into the deep, sombrous rift of Greenstream:
from where Gordon stood, on the
heights, in the flooding sun, it appeared to be already
evening below. As he descended the mountainside
the cool shadows rose about him, enveloping him in
the quietude, the sense of security, which brooded
over the withdrawn valley&mdash;the resplendent mirage
of nature kind, beneficent, the illusion of Nature as
a tender and loving parent&nbsp;...&nbsp;of Nature, as imminent,
as automatic, as a landslip crushing a path
to the far, secret resting place of its destiny.</p>
<p>Dr. Pelliter&#8217;s light carriage with its pair of weedy,
young horses stood hitched by the road above the
Makimmon dwelling; and, on entering the house,
Gordon found Clare in bed and Pelliter seated at
her side. A gaily-patched quilt hid all but her
head. She smiled at Gordon through her pale mask
of suffering; but her greeting turned to swift concern
at his battered countenance. &#8220;An accident,&#8221;
he explained impatiently.</p>
<p>The doctor greeted him seriously. He had,
Gordon knew, a sovereign and inevitable remedy for all
the ills of the flesh&mdash;pain, he argued, and disease
were inseparable, subdue the first and the latter
ceased to exist as an active ill, and a dexterously
wielded hypodermic needle left behind him a trail
of narcotized and relieved sufferers. Bottles of
patent medicines, exhilarating or numbing as the
purchaser might require, lined the shelves of his
drug store.</p>
<p>But now his customary, soothing smile was absent,
the small, worn case that contained the glittering
syringe and minute bottles filled with white or
vivid yellow pellets was not to be seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clare here&#8217;s gone and got herself real miserable,&#8221;
he stated, rising and beckoning Gordon to
follow him to the porch. &#8220;She&#8217;s bad,&#8221; he pronounced
outside; &#8220;that pain&#8217;s got the best of her, and
it&#8217;s getting the best of me. She ought to be cut, but
she&#8217;s so weak, it&#8217;s gone so long, that I&#8217;m kind of
slow about opening her. And the truth is, Gordon,
if I was successful she wouldn&#8217;t have a chance of
getting well here&mdash;it&#8217;ll take expert nursing, awful
nice food; and then, at the shortest, she would be in
bed a couple of months. She ought to go to the
hospital in Stenton. That&#8217;s the real truth. I&#8217;m
telling you the facts, Gordon; we can&#8217;t handle her
here, she&#8217;d die on us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon only half comprehended the other&#8217;s words&mdash;Clare
dangerously ill&nbsp;...&nbsp;a question of dying,
hospitals. She had suffered for so long that, without
losing his sympathy for her, it had seemed to him
her inevitable condition. It had fallen naturally
upon him to care for her, guard her against damp,
prevent her from lifting objects beyond her strength.
These continuous, small attentions held an important
place in his existence&mdash;he thought about her in a
mind devoted substantially to himself, and it
brought him a glow of contentment, a pleasant feeling
of ministration and importance. It had not occurred
to him that Clare might grow worse, that she
might, in fact, die. The idea filled him with sudden
dismay. His heart contracted with a sharp
hurt. &#8220;The hospital,&#8221; he echoed dully, &#8220;Stenton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By rights,&#8221; the doctor iterated; &#8220;of course we&#8217;ll
do what we can here, she might last for a couple of
years more without cutting; and then, again, her
heart might just quit. Still&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would the hospital cost?&#8221; Gordon asked,
almost unaware of having pronounced the words.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;d be dear&mdash;two hundred and some dollars
anyway, and the money on the nail. The nursing
would count up; then there would be something for
operating, if it was only a little&nbsp;...&nbsp;a lot of things
you don&#8217;t allow for would turn up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two hundred and more dollars! Gordon had a
fleeting vision, against the empurpling banks, the
dark, sliding water, and the mountainous wall
capped with dissolving gold beyond, of a room filled
with the hot glow of kerosene lamps; he saw Jake&#8217;s
twitching, murderous countenance above him....
Two hundred dollars! He had two hundred and
eighty dollars in his pocket. He had another vision&mdash;of
Simmons; it was two hundred and fifty dollars
that the latter wanted, must have, to-morrow. But
Simmons swiftly faded before Clare&#8217;s need, the pressure
of sickness.</p>
<p>&#8220;She couldn&#8217;t go down in the stage,&#8221; he muttered,
&#8220;the shaking would kill her before ever she got
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll drive her to Stenton, Gordon,&#8221; the doctor
volunteered, &#8220;if you&#8217;ve got the money handy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got her,&#8221; Gordon Makimmon declared
grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take her right to the hospital and give her
to the doctor in charge. Everything will be done
for her comfort. She has an elegant chance of pulling
through, there. And you can see her when you
go down with the stage&mdash;&#8221; Pelliter suddenly
stopped; he appeared disconcerted by what he had
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Gordon demanded, his attention held by
the other&#8217;s manner, &#8220;can&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were away from Greenstream yesterday
and to-day,&#8221; the doctor replied evasively, &#8220;you
didn&#8217;t hear&nbsp;...&nbsp;oh, there&#8217;s nothing in it if you
didn&#8217;t. I heard that Simmons had had you taken
off the stage. Did you have trouble with Buckley,
cut him with a whip? Buck has been blowing
about showing you a thing or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>A feeling of angry dismay enveloped Gordon.
He had recognized, obscurely, that Simmons and old
man Hollidew dominated the community, but he had
never before come in actual contact with their arbitrary
power, he had never before been faced by the
overmastering weapon of their material possessions,
the sheer weight of their wealth. It stirred him to
revolt, elemental and bitter; every instinct rose
against the despotic power which threatened to overwhelm
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;By God!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;but they will find that
I&#8217;m no sheep to drive into their lot and shear!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, about Clare,&#8221; the doctor interposed.</p>
<p>&#8220;When will you come for her?&#8221; Gordon inquired.
He took from his pocket the roll of money he had
won at Sprucesap, and counted two hundred dollars,
which he tended to the doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow, about seven. Everything will be
done for her, Gordon. I reckon that&#8217;s only an
empty splash about the stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dusk had thickened in Clare&#8217;s room; he could
scarcely distinguish her face white against the darkened
squares of the quilt. &#8220;Whoever will get your
supper,&#8221; she worried, when he had told her; &#8220;and
the cow&#8217;ll need bedding, and those cheeses brought
in off the roof, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He closed her mouth with a gentle palm. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
done &#8217;em all a hundred times,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;We&#8217;re
going to get you right, this spell, Clare,&#8221; he proclaimed;
&#8220;you&#8217;ll get professional, real stylish, care
at Stenton.&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose, trembling, on her arms. &#8220;Are they going
to cut at me?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>The lie on his lips perished silently before her
grave tones. &#8220;It&#8217;s not rightly a dangerous operation,&#8221;
he protested; &#8220;thousands come out of it every
year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gordon, I&#8217;m afeared of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re not, Clare Makimmon; there&#8217;s not a
drop of fear in you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just death I&#8217;m afeared of, it&#8217;s&mdash;oh;
you will never understand for being a man,&#8221; her
voice lowered instinctively; &#8220;somehow I hate the
thought of those strange men hacking and spoiling
my body. That&#8217;s just foolishness, I know, and my
time&#8217;s pretty well gone for foolishness. I&#8217;ve always
sort of tended my body, Gordon, and kept it white
and soft. I thought if a man asked me in spite of&mdash;well,
my face, he could take pride in me underneath.
But that&#8217;s all done with; I ought to be glad
for the&nbsp;...&nbsp;Gordon!&#8221; she exclaimed more
energetically, &#8220;it will cost a heap of money; how will you
get it? don&#8217;t borrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got it,&#8221; he interrupted her tersely, &#8220;and I
didn&#8217;t borrow it neither.&#8221;</p>

<p>He woke at dawn. The whippoorwills, the
frogs and crickets, were silent, and the
sharp, sweet song of a mocking bird
throbbed from a hedge. It was dark in the valley,
but, high above, the air was already brightening
with the sun; a symmetrical cloud caught the solar
rays and flushed rosy against silver space. The
valley turned from indistinct blue to grey, to sparkling
green. The sun gilded the peaks of the western
range, and slipped slowly down, spilling into
the depth. It was almost cold, the pump handle,
the rough sward, the foliage beyond, were drenched
with white dew; a damp, misty veil lifted from the
surface of the stream.</p>
<p>Clare declared that she felt stronger; she dressed,
insisted upon frying his breakfast. &#8220;You ought to
have somebody in,&#8221; she asserted later. They were
on the shallow porch, waiting stiffly for the doctor.
&#8220;But don&#8217;t get that eldest of your sister&#8217;s; last time
she wore my sateen waist and run the colors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just as she was leaving he slipped twenty dollars
into her hand. &#8220;Write when you want more,&#8221; he
directed; &#8220;and I&#8217;ll be down to see you&nbsp;...&nbsp;yes,
often&nbsp;...&nbsp;the stage.&#8221; A leaden depression settled
over him as the doctor&#8217;s carriage took her from sight.
The house to which he turned was deserted, lonely.
He locked the door to her room.</p>

<p>One of the canvas-covered mountain wagons
was unloading on the platform before
Simmons&#8217; store when Gordon entered the
center of the village. A miscellaneous pile of merchandise
was growing, presided over by a clerk with
a pencil and tally book. Valentine Simmons, without
his coat, in an immaculate, starched white waistcoat,
stood upon one side.</p>
<p>Gordon, without delay, approached him. &#8220;I can
give you a hundred dollars,&#8221; he informed the other,
exhibiting that sum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two hundred and fifty will be necessary,&#8221; Simmons
informed him concisely, &#8220;to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to reason&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Valentine Simmons turned his back squarely
upon him. A realization of the uselessness of further
words possessed Gordon; he returned the money
to his pocket. The contemptuous neglect of the
other lit the ever-trimmed lamp of his temper.
&#8220;What&#8217;s this,&#8221; he demanded, &#8220;I hear about driving
stage? about Buck boasting around that he had had
me laid off?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not correct,&#8221; Simmons informed him
smoothly; &#8220;Buckley has no power to do that&nbsp;...&nbsp;the
owners of the privilege decided that you were
too unreliable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s true,&#8221; Gordon interrupted him, &#8220;I&#8217;m
off?&#8221; Simmons nodded. Gordon&#8217;s temper swelled
and flared whitely before his vision; rage possessed
him utterly; without balance, check, he was no more
than an insensate force in the grip of his mastering
passion. He would stop that miserable, black heart
forever. Old Valentine Simmons&#8217; lips tightened,
his fingers twitched; he turned his back deliberately
upon Gordon. The metal buckle which held the
strap of his waistcoat caught the sun and reflected
it into Gordon&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;How many gross pink celluloid
rattles?&#8221; the storekeeper demanded of the
clerk.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon&#8217;s hand crept toward his
pocket&nbsp;...&nbsp;then he remembered&mdash;he had lost that
which he sought&nbsp;...&nbsp;on the side of Cheap Mountain.
If Simmons would turn, say something further,
taunt him, he would kill him with his hands.
But Simmons did none of these things; instead he
walked slowly, unharmed, into the store.</p>

<p>Gordon had intended to avoid the vicinity
of the Courthouse on the day of the sale of
his home, but an intangible attraction held
him in its neighborhood. He sat by the door to the
office of the <i>Greenstream Bugle</i>, diagonally across
the street. Within, the week&#8217;s edition was going to
press; a burly young individual was turning the
cylinders by hand, while the editor and owner dexterously
removed the printed sheets from the press.
The office was indescribably grimy, the rude ceiling
was hung with dusty cobwebs, the windows obscured
by a grey film. A small footpress stood to the left
of the entrance, on the right were ranged typesetter&#8217;s
cases with high, precarious stools, a handpress for
proof and a table to hold the leaded forms. These,
with the larger press, an air-tight sheet iron stove
and some nondescript chairs, completed the office
furnishings. Over all hung the smell of mingled
grease, ink, and damp paper, flat and penetrating.</p>
<p>Without, the sun shone ardently; it cast a rich
pattern of light and shade on the Courthouse lawn
and the small assemblage of merely idle or interested
persons gathered for the sale. The sheriff
stood facing them under the towering pillars of the
portico; his voice rang clearly through the air. To
Gordon the occasion, the loud sing-song of the sheriff,
appeared unreal, dreamlike; he listened incredulously
to the meager cataloguing of his dwelling, the
scant acreage, with an innate sense of outrage, of a
shameful violation of his privacy. He was still unable
to realize that his home and his father&#8217;s, the
clearing that his grandfather had cut from the wild,
was actually passing from his possession. He summoned
in vain the emotions which, he told himself,
were appropriate. The profound discouragement
within him would not be lifted to emotional heights:
lassitude settled over him like a fog.</p>
<p>The bidding began in scattered, desultory fashion,
mounting slowly by hundreds. Eighteen hundred
dollars was offered, and there the price obstinately
hung.</p>
<p>The owner of the <i>Bugle</i> appeared at his door, and
nodded mysteriously to Gordon, who rose and listlessly
obeyed the summons. The former closed the
door with great care, and lowered a faded and torn
shade over the front window. Then he retired to a
small space divided from the body of the office by
a curtain suspended from a sagging wire. He
brought his face close to Gordon&#8217;s ear. &#8220;Have a
nip?&#8221; he asked, in a solemn, guarded fashion.
Gordon assented.</p>
<p>A bottle was produced from a cupboard, and, together
with a tin cup, handed to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luck,&#8221; he pronounced half-heartedly, raising
the cup to his lips. When the other had gone
through a similar proceeding the process was carefully
reversed&mdash;the bottle was returned to the cupboard,
the tin cup suspended upon its hook, the
steps retraced and the curtain once more coaxed up,
the door thrown open.</p>
<p>The group on the Courthouse lawn were stringing
away; on the steps the sheriff was conversing
with Valentine Simmons&#8217; brother, a drab individual
who performed the storekeeper&#8217;s public services and
errands. The sale had been consummated. The
long, loose-jointed dwelling accumulated by successive
generations of Makimmons had passed out of
their possession.</p>
<p>A poignant feeling of loss flashed through Gordon&#8217;s
apathy; suddenly his eyes burned, and an
involuntary sharp inspiration resembled a gasp, a
sob. A shadow ran over the earth. The owner of
the <i>Bugle</i> stepped out and gazed upward. At the
sight of the soft, grey clouds assembling above an
expression of determined purpose settled upon his
dark countenance. He hurried into the office, and
reappeared a few minutes later, a peaked corduroy
hat drawn over his eyes, a piece of pasteboard in
one hand, and, under his arm, a long, slender bundle
folded in black muslin. The pasteboard he affixed
to the door; it said, &#8220;Gone fishing. Back to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Minus certain costs and the amount of his
indebtedness to Valentine Simmons, Gordon
received the sum of one thousand and
sixty dollars for the sale of his house. He was still
sleeping in it, but the day was near when he must
vacate. The greater part of his effects were gathered
under a canvas cover on the porch, Clare&#8217;s personal
belongings were still untouched in her room.
He must wait for the disposition of those until he
had learned the result of the operation.</p>
<p>He heard from Clare on an evening when he was
sitting on his lonely porch, twisting his dextrous
cigarettes, and brooding darkly on the mischances
that had overtaken him of late. It was hot and
steamy in the valley, no stars were visible; the known
world, muffled in a close and imponderable cloak,
was without any sign of life, of motion, of variety.
Gordon heard footsteps descending heavily from
the road, a bulky shape loomed up before him and
disclosed the features of Dr. Pelliter.</p>
<p>He greeted Gordon awkwardly, and then fell momentarily
silent. &#8220;She sent you a message, Gordon,&#8221;
he pronounced at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clare&#8217;s dead,&#8221; Gordon replied involuntarily.
So far away, he thought, and alone.... He must
go at once and fetch her home. He rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clare said,&#8221; the doctor continued, &#8220;if your sister&#8217;s
eldest was to come in to give her the sateen
waist.&#8221; An extended silence fell upon the men; the
whippoorwills sobbed and sobbed; the stream gurgled
past its banks. Then:</p>
<p>&#8220;By God!&#8221; Gordon said passionately, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know but I&#8217;m not glad Clare&#8217;s gone&mdash;Simmons has
got our house, I&#8217;m not driving stage&nbsp;...&nbsp;Clare
would have sorrowed herself out of living. Life&#8217;s
no jig tune.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor left. Gordon continued to sit on the
porch; at intervals he mechanically rolled and lit
cigarettes, which glowed for a moment and went out,
unsmoked. The feeling of depression that had
cloaked him during the few days past changed imperceptibly
to one of callous indifference toward existence
in general. The seeds of revolt, of instability,
which Clare and a measure of worldly
position, of pressure, had held in abeyance, germinated
in his disorganized mind, his bitter sense of
injustice and injury. He hardened, grew defiant&nbsp;...&nbsp;the
strain of lawlessness brought so many years
before from warring Scotch highlands rose bright
and troublesome in him.</p>

<p>Clare&#8217;s body was brought back to Greenstream
on the following day. His sister
and her numerous brood descended solicitously
upon Gordon later; neighbors, kindly and officious,
arrived&nbsp;...&nbsp;Clare was laid out. There
were sibilant, whispered conversations about a mislaid
petticoat with a mechlin hem; drawers were
searched and the missing garment triumphantly unearthed;
silk mitts were discussed, discarded; the
white shoes&mdash;real buck and a topnotch article&mdash;forced
on. At last Clare was exhibited in the room
that had been hers. There was no place in the
Makimmon dwelling for general assemblage but the
kitchen, and it had been pointed out by certain delicate
souls that the body and the preparations for the
funeral repast would accord but doubtfully. Besides,
the kitchen was too hot.</p>
<p>Clare&#8217;s peaked, blue-white countenance was withdrawn
and strange above a familiar, harsh black
silk dress; her hands, folded upon her flat breast, lay
in a doubled attitude dreadfully impossible to life.
A thin locket of gold hung on a chain about her still
throat. The odor of June roses that filled the
corners, a subdued, red riot of the summer, the sun
without, was overpowering.</p>
<p>As the hour appointed for the funeral approached
a gratifying number of people assembled: the
women clustered about the porch, hovered about the
door which opened upon the remains; while the
men gathered in a group above the stream, lingered
by the fence. A row of dusty, hooded vehicles,
rough-coated, intelligent horses, were hitched above.</p>
<p>The minister took his station by a table on which
a glass of water had been placed upon a vivid red
cover: he portentously cleared his throat. &#8220;The
Lord giveth,&#8221; he began.... It was noon, pellucidly
clear, still, hot; the foliage on the mountainsides
was like solid walls of greenery rising to a
canopy, a veil, of azure. Partridges whistled clear
and flutelike from a nearby cover; the stream flashed
in the sun, mirroring on its unwrinkled surface the
stiff, somber figures gathered for the funeral.</p>
<p>The droning voice of the preacher drew out interminably
through the sultry, golden hour.
Women sniffed sharply, dabbled with toil-hardened
hands at their eyes; the men, standing in the grass,
shuffled their feet uneasily. &#8220;Let us pray,&#8221; the
speaker dropped upon his knees, and his voice rose,
grew more insistent, shrill with a touch of hysteria.
From the back of the house a hen clucked in an excited,
aggravated manner.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon stood at the end of the porch,
morosely ill at ease: the memories of Clare as a girl,
as a woman going about and performing the duties
of their home, the dignity of his sense of loss and
sorrow, had vanished before this public ceremony;
they had sunk to perfunctory, conventional emotions
before the glib flood of the paid eulogist, the facile
emotion of the women.</p>
<p>Suddenly he saw, partially hidden by the dull
dresses of the older women, a white, ruffled skirt,
the turn of a young shoulder, a drooping straw hat.
A meager, intervening form moved, and he saw that
Lettice Hollidew had come to his sister&#8217;s funeral.
He wondered, in a momentary, instinctive resentment,
what had brought her among this largely
negligent gathering. She had barely known Clare;
Gordon was not certain that she had ever been in
their house. He could see her plainly now&mdash;she
stood clasping white gloves with firm, pink hands;
her gaze was lowered upon the uneven flooring of
the porch. He could see the soft contour of her
chin, a shimmer of warm, brown hair. She was
crisply fresh, incredibly young in the group of
gaunt, worn forms; her ruffled fairness was an affront
to the thin, rigid shoulders in rusty black, the
sallow, deeply-bitten faces of the other women.</p>
<p>She looked up, and surprised his intent gaze: she
flushed slightly, the gloves were twisted into a knot,
but her eyes were unwavering&mdash;they held an appeal
to his understanding, his sympathy, not to be mistaken.
It was evident that that gaze cost her an
effort. She was, Gordon remembered, a diffident
girl. His resentment evaporated.... He speculated
upon her reason for coming; and, speculating,
involuntarily stood more erect. With a swift, surreptitious
motion he straightened his necktie.</p>
<p>The Greenstream cemetery lay aslant on a rise
above the village. From the side of the raw, yellow
clay hole into which they lowered the coffin
Gordon could see, beyond the black form of the minister,
over the rows of uneven roofs, the bulk of the
Courthouse, the sweep of the valley, glowing with
multifarious vitality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dust to dust,&#8221; said the minister; &#8220;ashes to
ashes,&#8221; in the midst of the warm, the resplendent,
the palpitating day. One of Gordon&#8217;s nephews&mdash;a
shock of tow hair rising rebellious against an application
of soap, stubby, scarred hands, shoes obviously
come by in their descent from more mature
extremities&mdash;who had been audibly snuffling for the
past ten minutes, burst into a lugubrious, frightened
wail. Through the solemn, appointed periods of
the minister cut the sibilant, maternal promise of a
famous &#8220;whopping.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gordon thought again of Lettice Hollidew
as he was sitting for the last evening on the
porch of the dwelling that had passed out
of his hands. Twilight had poured through the
valley, thickening beneath the trees, over the stream;
the mountain ranges were dark, dusty blue against a
maroon sky. He recalled the sympathy, the plea for
comprehension, in Lettice&#8217;s gaze, lifted, for the first
time, frankly against his own.</p>
<p>Hers was not the feminine type which attracted
him; he preferred a more flamboyant beauty, ready
repartee, the conscious presence and employment of
the lure of sex. His taste had been fed by the paid
women of Stenton, the few, blowsy, loose females of
the mountains; these and the surface chatter of the
stage, and Clare, formed his sole knowledge, experience,
surmising, of women. He recalled Lettice
condescendingly; she did not stir his pulses, appeal
to his imagination. Yet she moved his pride, his inordinate
self-esteem. It had been on his account,
and not Clare&#8217;s, that she had come to the funeral.
The little affair with Buckley Simmons had
captured her attention and interest; he had not thought
Lettice so impressionable.</p>
<p>It was, he remembered, Wednesday night&mdash;there
would be prayer-meeting in the Methodist Church;
the Hollidews were Methodists; women, mostly, attended
prayer meeting. If he strolled about in that
vicinity he might see Lettice at the close of the service,
thank her for attending poor Clare&#8217;s funeral.</p>
<p>He rose and negligently made his way through
the soft gloom past the Courthouse to the Methodist
Church. The double doors were open, and a flood
of hot radiance rolled out into the night, together
with the familiar tones of old Martin Seeker loudly
importuning his invisible, inscrutable Maker.
There were no houses opposite the church, and, balanced
obscurely on the fence of split rails against
the unrelieved night, a row of young men smoked
redly glowing cigarettes; while, on the ground below
them, shone the lanterns by the aid of which
they escorted the various maidens of their choice on
their various obscure ways.</p>
<p>The prayer stopped abruptly, and, after a momentary
silence, the dolorous wail of a small organ abetted
a stridulent concourse of human voices lifted in
lamentable song, a song in which they were desirous
of being winged like the dove.</p>
<p>The sound mounted in a grievous minor into the
profound stillness, the peace, of the valley, of the
garment of stars drawn from wall to wall. There
was something animal-like in its long-drawn, quavering
note&mdash;like the baying of a dog out of the
midst of his troubled darkness at the remote, silver
serenity, the disturbing, effortless splendor, of the
moon.</p>
<p>The line of figures without, sitting on the fence
with their feet caught under the second rail, smoked
in imperturbable, masculine indifference. There
was, shortly, a stir within, a moving blur of figures
in the opened doors, and the lanterns swung alertly to
the foot of the steps, where, one by one, the bobbing
lights, detached from the constellation, vanished into
the night.</p>
<p>Almost immediately Gordon saw Lettice Hollidew
standing at the entrance, awaiting a conversing
group of older women at the head of the aisle. She
recognized him, and descended immediately with a
faint, questioning smile. The smile vanished as she
greeted him; her eyes were dark on a pale, still
countenance. He noticed that she was without the
heady perfume which stirred him as the other girls
passed, and he was silently critical of the omission.</p>
<p>He delivered quickly, with a covert glance above,
the customary period about seeing her home. Immediately
she walked with him into the obscurity, the
mystery, of the night.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was certainly nice-hearted of you to come to
Clare&#8217;s funeral,&#8221; he began.</p>
<p>Close beside him she shivered, it might be at the
memory of that occasion. She was without a hat,
and he was able to study her profile: it was irregular,
with a low, girlish brow and a nose too heavy for
beauty; she had a full under lip and a strongly
modelled chin, a firm line ending in a generous
throat, milk-white in the gloom. Her figure too, he
judged, was too heavy for his standard of feminine
charm. His interest in her burned low, sustained
only by what he recognized as a conquest.</p>
<p>She walked slowly and more slowly as he dallied
by her side. Almost subconsciously he adopted the
tone by which he endeavored to enlist the interest of
the opposite sex: he repeated in a perfunctory manner
the stereotyped remarks appropriate for such
occasions.</p>
<p>She listened intently, with sudden, little glances
from a momentarily lifted gaze. He grew impatient
at the absence of the flattering responses to
which he was largely accustomed. And, dropping
abruptly his artificial courtesy, he maintained a sullen
silence, quickened his stride. He drew some
satisfaction from the observation that his reticence
hurt her. Her hands caught and strained together;
she looked at him with a longer, questioning gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to tell you,&#8221; she said finally, with palpable
difficulty, &#8220;how sorry I am about&nbsp;...&nbsp;about
things; your home, and&mdash;and I heard of the stage,
too. It was a shame, you drove beautifully, and
took such care of the passengers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was that care cost me the place,&#8221; he answered
with brutal directness; &#8220;old Simmons did it; him
and his precious Buckley.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stopped with an expression of instant, deep
concern. &#8220;Oh! I am so sorry&nbsp;...&nbsp;then it was
my fault. But it&#8217;s horrid that they should have
done that; that they should be able; it is all
wrong&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right nor wrong don&#8217;t make any figure I&#8217;ve ever
discovered,&#8221; he retorted; &#8220;Valentine Simmons has
the power, he&#8217;s got the money. That&#8217;s it&mdash;money&#8217;s
the right of things; it took my house away from me,
like it&#8217;s taken away so many houses, so many farms,
in Greenstream&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; she objected timidly, &#8220;didn&#8217;t they owe
Mr. Simmons for things? You see, people borrow,
borrow, borrow, and never pay back. My father,&#8221;
she proceeded with more confusion, &#8220;has lost lots of
money in that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can tell you all about that,&#8221; he informed her
bitterly, proceeding to mimic Simmons&#8217; dry, cordial
tones, &#8220;&#8216;Take the goods right along with you, pay
when you like, no hurry between old friends.&#8217;
Then, when Zebener Hull&#8217;s corn failed, &#8216;I&#8217;ll trouble
you for that amount,&#8217; the skinflint says, and sells
Zebener out. And what your father&#8217;s lost,&#8221; he
added more directly still, &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t take you on
the stage to Stenton. Your father and Simmons
have got about everything worth getting in the
county; they&#8217;ve got the money, they&#8217;ve got the land,
they&#8217;ve got the men right in their iron safes. Right
and wrong,&#8221; he sneered, &#8220;it&#8217;s money&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! please,&#8221; she begged, &#8220;please don&#8217;t be so unhappy,
so hard. Life isn&#8217;t as dreadful as that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s worse,&#8221; he declared somberly. They turned
by Simmons&#8217; store, but continued in the opposite direction
from the one-time Makimmon dwelling.
They passed a hedge of roses; the perfume hung
heavy-sweet, poignant; there was apparently no sky,
no earth, only a close, purple envelopment, imminent,
palpable, lying languidly, unstirring, in a
space without form or limit and of one color.</p>
<p>Lettice walked silently by his side; he could hear
her breathing, irregular, quick. She was very close
to him, then moved suddenly, consciously, away;
but, almost immediately, she drifted back, brushing
his shoulder; it seemed that she returned inevitably,
blindly; in the gloom her gown fluttered like the
soft, white wings of a moth against him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s worse,&#8221; he repeated, his voice loud and
harsh, like a discordant bell clashing in the
sostenuto passage of a symphony; &#8220;but it&#8217;s all one to me&mdash;there&#8217;s
nothing else they can take; I&#8217;m free, free
to sleep or wake, to be drunk when I like with no
responsibility to Simmons or any one else&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her breathing increasingly grew labored, oppressed;
a little sob escaped, softly miserable. She
was crying. He was completely callous, indifferent.
They stood before the dark, porchless façade
of her home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought life was so happy,&#8221; she articulated,
facing him; &#8220;but now it hurts me&nbsp;...&nbsp;here;&#8221; he
saw her press her hand against the swelling, tender
line of her breast. His theatrical self-consciousness
bowed him over the other hand, pressing upon it a
half-calculated kiss. She stood motionless; he felt
rather than saw the intensity of her gaze. &#8220;I wish
I could mend the hurt,&#8221; he began, appropriately,
professionally.</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a figure emerging from
the obscurity of the house. Pompey Hollidew
peered at them from the low, stone lintel. &#8220;Letty,&#8221;
he pronounced, in a voice at once whining and truculent;
&#8220;who?&mdash;oh! that Makimmon.... Letty,
come in the house.&#8221; He caught her arm and
dragged her incontinently toward the door.
&#8220;...&nbsp;rascal,&#8221; Gordon heard him mutter, &#8220;spendthrift.
If you ever walk again with Gordon Makimmon,&#8221;
the old man, through his daughter,
addressed the other, &#8220;don&#8217;t walk back here, don&#8217;t come
home. Not a dollar of mine shall fall through the
pockets of that shiftless breed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clare&#8217;s funeral deducted a further sum
from the amount Gordon had received for
the sale of his home, but he had left still
nine hundred and odd dollars. He revolved in his
mind the disposition of this sum, once more sitting
with chair tilted back against the dingy wooden home
of the <i>Greenstream Bugle</i>; he rehearsed its possibilities
for frugality, for independence, as a reserve&nbsp;...&nbsp;or
for pleasure. It was the hottest hour of the
day; the prospect before him, the uneven street, the
houses beyond, were coated with dust, gilded by the
refulgent sun. No one stirred; a red cow that had
been cropping the grass in the broad, shallow gutter
opposite sank down in the meager shadow of
a chance pear tree; even the children were absent,
the piercing, staccato cries of their games unheard.</p>
<p>To Gordon Makimmon Greenstream suddenly appeared
insufferably dull, empty; the thought of
monotonous, identical days spun thinly out, the
nine hundred dollars extended to its greatest length,
in that banal setting, suddenly grew unbearable....
There was no life in Greenstream....</p>
<p>The following morning found him on the front
seat of the Stenton stage, sharing with the driver
not his customary cigarettes but more portentous
cigars from an ample pocketful. &#8220;Greenstream&#8217;s
dead,&#8221; he pronounced; &#8220;I&#8217;m going after some
life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Late that night he leaned across the sloppy bar
of an inferior saloon in Stenton, and, with an uncertain
wave of his hand, arrested the barkeeper&#8217;s attention.
&#8220;I&#8217;m here,&#8221; he articulated thickly, &#8220;to see
life, understand! And I can see it too&mdash;money&#8217;s
power.&#8221; The other regarded him with a brief,
mechanical interest, a platitude shot suavely from
hard, tobacco-stained lips.</p>
<p>Later still: &#8220;I&#8217;m here to see life,&#8221; he told a
woman with a chalky countenance, a countenance
without any expression of the consciousness of the
sound of his voice, a vague form lost in loose draperies.
&#8220;Life,&#8221; he emphasized above the continuous,
macabre rattle of a piano.</p>
<p>In a breathless, hot dawn pouring redly into the
grey city street, he swayed like a pendulum on the
steaming pavement. His side was smeared, caked,
with unnamable filth, refuse; a tremulous hand
gripped feverishly the shoulder of a policeman who
had roused him from a constrained stupor in a casual
angle. &#8220;I wan&#8217; to see life,&#8221; he mumbled dully, &#8220;I
got power&nbsp;...&nbsp;money.&#8221; He fumbled through his
pockets in search of the proof of his assertion. In
vain&mdash;all that was left of the nine hundred and sixty
dollars was some loose silver.</p>

<p>Again sober, without the resources of the
citybred parasite, and without money, his
instinct, his longing, drew him irresistibly
into the open; his heredity forced him toward the
mountains, into familiar paths, valleys, heights.</p>
<p>He avoided the stage road, and progressed toward
Greenstream by tangled trails, rocky ascents, sharp
declines. By late day he had penetrated to the heart
of the upland region. He stood gazing down upon
the undulating, verdant hills, over which he could
trace the course of a thunder gust. The storm
moved swiftly, in a compact, circular shadow on the
sunny slope; he could distinguish the sudden twisting
of limbs, the path of torn leaves, broken
branches, left by the lash of the wind and rain. The
livid, sinister spot on the placid greenery drew
nearer; he could now hear the continuous rumble of
thunder, see the stabbing, purplish flashes of lightning.
The edge of the storm swept darkly over the
spot where he was standing; he was soaked by a
momentary assault of rain driving greyly out of a
passing, profound gloom. Then the cloud
vanished, leaving the countryside sparkling and serene
under a stainless evening sky.</p>
<p>The water dripped down his back, swashed in his
shoes; he was, in his lowered vitality, supremely uncomfortable.
The way was slippery with mud; wet
leaves bathed his face in sudden, chill showers, clung
to his hands. He fell.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the rim of Greenstream night
had hidden that familiar, welcome vista. The
lights of the houses shone pale yellow below. A
new reluctance to enter this place of home possessed
him, a shame born of his denuded pockets,
his bedraggled exterior. He descended, but turned
to the left, finding a rude road which skirted the
base of the eastern range. He was following no
definite plan, moving slowly, without objective; but
a window glimmering in a square of orange light
against the night brought him to a halt. It marked,
he knew, the dwelling of the Jesuit priest, Merlier.
In a sudden impulse he advanced over a short path,
and fumbling, found the door, where he knocked.
A chair scraped within and the door swung open.
The form of the priest was dark against the lighted
interior which absorbed them.</p>

<p>The room was singularly bare: a tin lamp
with a green glass shade, on an uncovered
deal table, illuminated an open book, wood
chairs with roughly split, hickory backs, a couch
with no covering over its wire springs and iron
frame; there was no carpet on the floor of loosely
grooved boards, no decorations on the plastered
walls save a dark engraving of a man in intricate
armor, with a face as passionate, as keen, as relentless,
as a hawk&#8217;s, labelled, &#8220;Loyola.&#8221;</p>
<p>Merlier silently indicated a chair, but he remained
standing with his gaze lowered upon the
floor. He was a burly man, with a heavy countenance
impassive as an oriental&#8217;s, out of which,
startling in its unexpected rapidity, a glance flashed
and stabbed as steely as Loyola&#8217;s sword. His
hands were clasped before him; they were, in that
environment, strangely white, and covered with the
scars of what, patently, were unaccustomed employments.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels good inside,&#8221; Gordon observed tritely.
He noted uneasily the muddy tracks his shoes had
printed upon the otherwise spotless board floor,
&#8220;I got caught in a gust on the mountain,&#8221; he explained
awkwardly, in a constraint which deepened
with the other&#8217;s continued silence; &#8220;I ought to have
cleaned up before I came in&nbsp;...&nbsp;it&#8217;s terrible dark
out.&#8221; He rose, tentatively, but the priest waved
him back into the chair. Opening a door opposite
the one by which Gordon had entered, and which
obviously gave upon an outer shed, Merlier procured
a roughly made mop; and, returning, he obliterated
all traces of the mud. Suddenly, to Gordon&#8217;s
dismay, his supreme discomfort, he stooped to a
knee, and began to remove the former&#8217;s shoes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey!&#8221; Gordon protested; &#8220;don&#8217;t do that; I can
tend to my own feet.&#8221; He was prepared to kick out,
but he recognized that a struggle could only make
the situation insufferable, and he submitted in an
acute, writhing misery to the ministrations. The
priest rose with Gordon&#8217;s shoes and placed them,
together with the mop, outside the door. He then
brought from an inner room an immaculate, white
cambric shirt, a pair of trousers, old but carefully
ironed, and knitted, grey worsted slippers.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will change,&#8221; he said in a low, impersonal
voice, &#8220;I will see what there is for you to eat.&#8221;
He left the room, and Gordon gratefully shifted into
the fresh, dry clothes. The trousers were far too
large; they belonged, he recognized, to the priest,
but he belted them into baggy folds. The other appeared
shortly with a wooden tray bearing a platter
of cooked, yellow beans, a part loaf of coarse bread,
raw eggs and a pitcher of milk. &#8220;I thought,&#8221; he
explained, &#8220;you would wish something immediately;
there is no fire; Bartamon is out.&#8221; The latter, Gordon
knew, was a sharp-witted old man who had
made a precarious living in the local fields and
woodsheds until the priest had taken him as a general
helper. &#8220;There are neither coffee nor tea in
the house,&#8221; Merlier stated further.</p>
<p>He closed the book, moved the lamp to the end
of the table, and stood with his countenance lowered,
his folded hands immovable as stone, while Gordon
Makimmon consumed the cold food. Once the
priest replenished the other&#8217;s glass with milk.</p>
<p>If there had been a gleam of fraternal feeling,
the slightest indication of generous impulse, a mere
accent of hospitality, in the priest&#8217;s actions, Gordon,
accepting them in such spirit, might have been at
ease. But not the faintest spark of interest, of curiosity,
the most perfunctory communion of sympathy,
was evident on Merlier&#8217;s immobile countenance; his
movements were machine-like, he seemed infinitely
removed from his charitable act, infinitely cold.</p>
<p>Gordon&#8217;s discomfort burned into a species of illogical,
resentful anger. He cursed the priest under
his breath, choked on the food; he was heartily
sorry that he had obeyed the fleeting impulse to enter.
But even the anger expired before Merlier&#8217;s impassivity&mdash;he
must as well curse a figure carved from
granite, cast in lead. He grew, in turn, uneasy at
the other&#8217;s supernatural detachment; it chilled his
blood like the grip of an unexpected, icy hand, like
the imminence of inevitable death. The priest resembled
a dead man, a dead man who had remained
quick in the mere physical operations of the body,
while all the machinery of his thoughts, his feelings,
lay motionless and cold within.</p>
<p>Gordon found relief in a customary cigarette when
the uncomfortable repast was finished. The priest
removed the dishes, and reappeared with bed linen,
with which he proceeded to convert the bare couch
into a provision for sleeping. Then he returned
the lamp to the center of the table, opened the book
and seated with his back squarely toward the room,
addressed himself to the pages.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon&#8217;s head throbbed, suddenly
paining him&mdash;it was as though sharp, malicious fingers
were compressing the spine at the base of his
brain. That, and the profound weariness which
swept over him, were disconcerting; he was so seldom
ill, so rarely tired, that those unwelcome symptoms
bore an aggravated menace; it was the slight,
premonitory rusting, the corrosion of time, upon the
iron of his manhood.</p>
<p>In an instinctive need for human support, the reassurance
of the comprehension of his kind, he directed
an observation at the broad, squat, somber
back. &#8220;I might have been drunk a month,&#8221; he
asserted, &#8220;by the way I feel.&#8221; The priest paused
in his reading, inserted a finger in the page, and half
turned. Gordon could see the full, smooth cheek,
the drooping gaze, against the green radiance of the
lamp.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will drink,&#8221; Merlier said in a bitter, repressed
voice, &#8220;if you will indulge the flesh, don&#8217;t
whimper at the price.&#8221; He made a gesture, indicating
the bed, then returned to his reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man doesn&#8217;t live who&#8217;s heard me whimper,&#8221;
Gordon began loudly; but his angry protest trailed
into silence. There was no comfort, no redress, to
be obtained from that absorbed, ungainly figure.
He slipped out of the baggy trousers, the worsted
slippers, and, extending himself on the couch, fell
heavily asleep.</p>

<p>When he woke the room was bright with
narrow strips of sun, already too high
to shine broadly through the doors and
windows. His clothes, dry and comparatively
clean, reposed on a chair at his side, and, washing
in the basin which he found outside the door, he hastily
dressed. He looked, tentatively, for the priest,
but found only his aged helper in the roughly-cleared
space at the back of the house.</p>
<p>Bartamon was a small man, with a skull-like
head, to the hollows of which, the bony projections,
dark skin clung dryly; his eyes were mere dimming
glints of watery consciousness; and from the sleeves
of a faded blue shirt, the folds of formless, canvas
trousers, knotted, blackish hands, grotesque feet, appeared
to hang jerking on wires.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the Father?&#8221; Gordon inquired.</p>
<p>The other rested from the laborious sawing of a
log, blinking and tremulous in the hard brilliancy of
midday. &#8220;Beyond,&#8221; he answered vaguely, waving
up the valley; &#8220;Sim Caley&#8217;s wife sent for him from
Hollidew&#8217;s farm. Sim or his wife think they&#8217;re
going to die two or three times the year, and bother
the Father.... But I wouldn&#8217;t wonder they would,
and them working for Hollidew, dawn, day and
dark, with never a proper skinful of food, only this
and that, maybe, chick&#8217;ry and fat pork and moldy
ends of nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He filled the blackened ruin of a pipe, shaking in
his palsied fingers, clasped it in mumbling, toothless
gums: he was so sere, so juiceless, that the smoke
trailing from his sunken lips might well have been
the spontaneous conflagration of his desiccated interior.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hollidew&#8217;s a terrible man for money,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;it hurts him like a cut with a hick&#8217;ry to
see a dollar go. They say he won&#8217;t hear tell of
quitting his fortune for purgatory, no, nor for
heaven neither. He can&#8217;t get him to make a will,
the lawyer can&#8217;t. He was telling the Father the
other day, sitting right in the house there, &#8216;Pompey
Hollidew,&#8217; he says, &#8216;won&#8217;t even talk will....&#8217;
He&#8217;d like to take it all with him to the devil, Pompey
would.&#8221; He turned with a sigh to the log. A cross-cut
saw, with a handle at either end, lay upon the
ground; and Gordon, grasping the far handle,
helped him to drag the slim, glittering steel through
the powdering fiber of the wood.</p>
<p>As he worked mechanically Gordon&#8217;s thoughts returned
to the past, the past which had collapsed
so utterly, so disastrously, so swiftly upon his complacency,
robbing him of his sustenance, of Clare, of
his home. The complaining voice of the old man
finally pierced his abstraction. &#8220;If you are going
to ride,&#8221; Bartamon complained, &#8220;don&#8217;t drag your
feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men consumed a formless, ample meal,
after which Gordon still waited negligently for the
priest. The sun sank toward the western range; the
late afternoon grew as hushed, as rich in color, in
vert shadows, ultramarine, and amber, as heavy in
foliage bathed in aureate light, as the nave of a
cathedral under stained glass.</p>
<p>In a corner of the shed Gordon found a fishing
rod of split bamboo, sprung with time and neglect,
the wrappings hanging and effectually loose. A
small brass reel was fastened to the butt, holding
an amount of line. He balanced the rod in his
grasp, discovering it to be the property of the old
man.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll you take for it?&#8221; he demanded. His
store of money had been reduced to a precarious sum
of silver; but the longing had seized him to fish in
the open, to follow a stream into the tranquil dusk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got some flies too.&#8221; The other resurrected a
cigar box, which held some feathered hooks attached
to doubtful guts. &#8220;They are dried out,&#8221; Gordon
pronounced, testing them; &#8220;what will you take for
the whole worthless lot?&#8221; Bartamon demurred:
the rod had been a good rod, it had been given to
him in the past by a mayor, or had it been a senator?
It was not like common rods, made of six strips of
bamboo, but of eight, the line was silk.... He
would take sixty cents.</p>
<p>Delaying his expression of gratitude to the priest&mdash;he
could stop on his return with trout&mdash;Gordon
was soon tramping over the soft, dusty road to where
he bordered a stream skirting the eastern range.
A shelf of pasturage ran, deep blue-green sod,
against the rocky wall; to the left, through scattered
trees, the valley was visible; on the right the range
mounted precipitant, verdant, to its far crown. The
stream, now torn to white foam on a rocky descent,
now swept with a glassy rush between level, green
banks, now moved slowly in a deep-shaded pool,
where gleaming bubbles held filmed sliding replicas
of the banks, the trees, the sky.</p>
<p>The sun, growing less a source of light than a
brilliant circle of carmine, almost touched the western
range; the shadow troop swept down the slope
and lengthened across the valley; cut by the trunks
of trees the light fell in dusty gold bars across the
water. Gordon drew the line through the dipping
tip, knotting on three of the flies. Then he quietly
followed the stream to where it fell into a circular,
stone-bound basin. He made his cast with a quick
turn of the wrist, skilfully avoiding the high underbrush,
the overhanging limbs. The flies swung out
and dropped softly on the water. On the second
cast he caught a trout&mdash;a silvery, gleaming shape
flecked with vermilion and black, shaded with mauve
and emerald and maroon.</p>
<p>In a shallow reach he waded, forgetful of his
clothes. He caught another trout, another and another,
stringing them on a green withe. He cast
indefatigably, but with the greatest possible economy
of effort; his progress was all but soundless; he
slipped down stream like a thing of the woods, fishing
with delicate art, with ardor, with ingenuity, and
with continual success.</p>
<p>The sun disappeared in a primrose void behind
the darkening mountains; the hush deepened upon
the valley, a hush in which the voice of the stream
was audible, cool&mdash;a sound immemorially old, lingering
from the timeless past through vast, dim
changes, cataclysms, carrying the melancholy, eloquent,
incomprehensible plaint of primitive nature.</p>
<p>Gordon was absorbed, content; the quiet, the
magic veil of oblivion, of the woods, of the immobile
mountains, enveloped and soothed him, released
his heart from its oppression, banished the fever, the
struggle, from his brain. The barrier against
which he still fished was mauve, the water black; the
moon appeared buoyantly, like a rosy bubble blown
upon a curtain of old blue velvet. He cast once
more, and met his last strike, a heavy jar that broke
the weakened line, in a broad, still expanse where
white moths fluttered above the water in a cold, stagnant
gloom. He saw the rotting wall of a primitive
dam, the crumbling, fallen sides of a rude mill.
Night fell augustly. The whippoorwills cried faint
and distant.</p>
<p>He sat on a log, draining his shoes, pressing the
water from his trousers, and smoked while the light
of the moon brightened into a silvery radiance in
which objects, trees, were greyly visible; reaches
sank into soft obscurity. He recognized his position
from the ruined mill&mdash;he was on the edge of that
farm of Pompey Hollidew&#8217;s of which Bartamon had
spoken. Hollidew, he knew, seldom visited his outlying
acres, then only in the collection of rents or
profits&mdash;they lay too far from his iron chest, from
the communication of the Stenton banks. Gordon
knew Sim Caley, and, suddenly, he decided to visit
him; the trout would afford the Caleys and himself
an ample repast.</p>
<p>He crossed the road, made his way through a fragrant
tangle of field grass, over shorn and orderly
acres of grazing. The moon rose higher, grew
brighter; the vistas were clear, unreal, the shadows
like spilled ink. The house toward which he moved
stood sharply defined, and enclosed by a fence,
flowers, from the farm. As he approached he saw that
no lights were visible, but a blur of white moved in
the shadow of the portico. He decided that it was
Sim Caley&#8217;s wife; and, opening the gate, advanced
with a query for Mrs. Caley&#8217;s health forming on his
lips.</p>
<p>But it was Lettice Hollidew.</p>

<p>She retreated, as he advanced, within the
deeper obscurity of an opened door but he had
seen, in the shimmering, elusive light, her
features, gathered the unmistakable, intangible impression
of her person.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s me, Gordon Makimmon,&#8221; he said. He
paused by the step, on which he laid the trout, shining
with sudden, liquid gleams of silver in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she exclaimed in a low voice; &#8220;oh!&#8221; She
moved forward, materializing, out of the dark, into
a figure of white youth. Her face was pale, there
were white ruffles on her neck, on her arms, her skirt
clung simply, whitely, about her knees and ankles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I stopped to see Sim,&#8221; he explained further, &#8220;and
took you for Mrs. Caley. I reckoned I&#8217;d bring
them some trout: I didn&#8217;t know your father was
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you sit down. Mrs. Caley is sick, and
Sim&#8217;s on the mountain with the cattle. Father isn&#8217;t
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He mounted to the portico, mentally formulating
a way of speedy escape; he thought, everywhere he
turned Lettice Hollidew stood with her tiresome
smile. &#8220;I come out here every summer,&#8221; she volunteered,
sinking upon a step, &#8220;and spend two weeks.
I was born here you see, and,&#8221; she added in a stiller
voice, &#8220;my mother died here. Father Merlier calls
it my yearly retreat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be pleased if you&#8217;d take the fish,&#8221; he remarked;
&#8220;I guess I&#8217;d better be moving&mdash;I&#8217;ve got to
see the priest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you haven&#8217;t stopped a minute,&#8221; she protested,
&#8220;not long enough to smoke one of your little
cigarettes. Visitors are too scarce here to let
them go off like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the implied suggestion he half-mechanically
rolled a cigarette. The chair he found was comfortable;
he was very weary. He sat smoking and
indifferently studying Lettice Hollidew. She was,
to-night, prettier than he had remembered her. She
was telling him, in a voice that rippled cool and low
like the stream, of Mrs. Caley&#8217;s indisposition. Her
face, now turned toward the fields, was dipped in the
dreaming radiance; now it was blurred, vaguely appealing,
disturbing. Her soft youth was creamy,
distilling an essence, a fragrance, like a flower; it was
one with the immaculate flood of light bathing the
world in virginal beauty.</p>
<p>A new interest stirred within him, a satisfaction
grew from her palpable liking for him, and was
reflected in the warmer tones of his replies; a new
pain ordered his comments. The situation, too,
appealed to him; his instinct responded to the obvious
implications of the position in the exact degree
of his habit of mind. The familiar, professional
gallantry took possession of him, directing
the sensuality to which he abandoned himself.</p>
<p>He moved from the chair to the step by her side.
Nearer she was more appealing still; a lovely
shadow dwelt at the base of her throat; the simple
dress took the soft curves of her girlish body, stirred
with her breathing. Her hands lay loosely in her
lap, and the impulse seized him to take them up, but
he repressed it&nbsp;...&nbsp;for the moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw Buckley Simmons, yesterday,&#8221; she informed
him, &#8220;his face is nearly well. He wanted
to come out here, but I wouldn&#8217;t let him. He wants
to marry me,&#8221; she continued serenely; &#8220;I told him
I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d every marry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you will&mdash;some lucky, young man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I like young men, that is,&#8221; she
qualified carefully, &#8220;not very young. I like men
who are able to act ever so quickly, no matter what
occurs, and they must be terribly brave. I like
them best if they have been unfortunate; something
in me wants to make up to them for&mdash;for any loss,&#8221;
she paused, gazing at him with an elevated chin,
serious lips, intent eyes.</p>
<p>This, he told himself complacently, was but a description
of himself, as pointed as she dared to
make it. &#8220;A man who had had trouble couldn&#8217;t
do better than tell you about it,&#8221; he assured her;
&#8220;I have had a good lot of trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, tell me,&#8221; she moved toward him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! you wouldn&#8217;t care to hear about mine. I&#8217;m
a sort of nobody at present. I haven&#8217;t anything in
the world&mdash;no home, nothing in the whole world.
Even the little saving I had after the house was sold
was&mdash;was taken from me by sharpers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; she repeated, &#8220;more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When Valentine Simmons had sold my place, the
place my grandfather built, I had about a thousand
dollars left, and I thought I would start a little
business with it, a&nbsp;...&nbsp;a gun store,&mdash;I like guns,&mdash;here
in Greenstream. And I&#8217;d sharpen scythes,
put sickles into condition, you know, things like
that. I went to Stenton with my capital in my
pocket, looking for some stock to open with, and
met a man in a hotel who said he was the representative
of the Standard Hardware Company. He
could let me have everything necessary, he said, at a
half of what others would charge. We had dinner
together, and he made a list of what I would need&mdash;files
and vises and parts of guns. If I mailed my
cheque immediately I could get the half off. He
had cards, catalogues, references, from Richmond.
I might write there, but I&#8217;d lose time and money.</p>
<p>&#8220;None of the Makimmons have been good business
men; we are not distrustful. I sent the cheque
to the address he said, made out to him for the
Standard Hardware Company, so that he would get
the commission, the credit of the sale.&#8221; He drew
a deep breath, gazing across the moonlit fields.
&#8220;The Makimmons are not distrustful,&#8221; he reiterated;
&#8220;he robbed me of all my savings.&#8221;</p>
<p>His lie would have fared badly with Pompey Hollidew,
he thought grimly; it was unconvincing,
wordy; he was conscious that his assumed emotion
rang thinly. But its calculated effect was instantaneous,
beyond all his hopes, his plan.</p>
<p>Lettice leaned close to him with a sobbing inspiration
of sympathy and pity. &#8220;How terrible!&#8221; she
cried in low tones; &#8220;you were so noble&mdash;&#8221; He
breathed heavily once more. &#8220;What a wicked,
wicked man. Couldn&#8217;t you get anything back?
did it all go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All.&#8221; His hand fell upon hers, and neither of
them appeared to notice its pressure. Her face was
close to his, a tear gleamed on her young, moon-blanched
cheek. A sudden impatience seized him
at her credulity, a contempt at the ease with which
she was victimized; the effort was almost without
spice. Still his grasp tightened upon her hand, drew
it toward him. &#8220;In Greenstream,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;men don&#8217;t like me, they are afraid of me; but the
women make me unhappy&mdash;they tell me their troubles;
I don&#8217;t want them to, I keep away from them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that,&#8221; she declared eagerly, &#8220;I
would tell you anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are different; I want you to tell me&nbsp;...&nbsp;things.
But the things I want to hear may not
come to you. I would never be satisfied with a little.
The Makimmons are all that way&mdash;everything
or nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gently loosened her hand, and stood up, facing
him. Her countenance, turned to the light,
shone like a white flame; it was tensely aquiver with
passionate earnestness, lambent with the flowering
of her body, of dim desire, the heritage of flesh. She
spoke in a voice that startled Gordon by its new
depth, the brave thrill of its undertone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could only give all,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am like that
too. What do you wish me to tell you? What can
I say that will help you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever since I first saw you going to the Stenton
school,&#8221; he hurried on, &#8220;I have thought about you.
I could hardly wait for the Christmas holidays, to
have you in the stage, or for the summer when you
came home. Nobody knows; it has been a secret&nbsp;...&nbsp;it
seemed so useless. You were like a&nbsp;...&nbsp;a
star,&#8221; he told her.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could I know?&#8221; she asked; &#8220;I was only a
girl until&mdash;until Buckley&nbsp;...&nbsp;until to-night, now.
But I can never be that again, something has happened&nbsp;...&nbsp;in
my heart, something has gone, and
come,&#8221; her voice grew shadowed, wistful. It carried
to him, in an intangible manner, a fleet warning,
as though something immense, unguessed, august,
uttered through Lettice Hollidew the whisper of a
magnificent and terrible menace. He felt again as
he had felt as a child before the vast mystery of
night. An impulse seized him to hurry away
from the portico, from the youthful figure at his side;
a sudden, illogical fear chilled him. But he summoned
the hardihood, the skepticism, of his heart;
he defied&mdash;while the sinking within him persisted&mdash;not
the girl, but the nameless force beyond, above,
about them. &#8220;You are like a star,&#8221; he repeated, in
forced tones.</p>
<p>He rose and stood before her. She swayed toward
him like a flower bowed by the wind. He put
his arms around her, her head lay back, and he
kissed the smooth fullness of her throat. He kissed
her lips.</p>
<p>The eternal, hapless cry of the whippoorwills
throbbed on his hearing. The moon slipped behind
a corner of the house, and a wave of darkness
swept over them. Lettice began to tremble violently,
and he led her back to their place on the veranda&#8217;s
edge. She was silent, and clung to him with a
reluctant eagerness. He kissed her again and again,
on a still mouth, but soon her lips answered his desire.
It grew constantly darker, the silvery vistas
shortened, grew blurred, trees merged into indistinguishable
gloom.</p>
<p>Lettice murmured a shy, unaccustomed endearment.
Gordon was stereotyped, commonplace; he
was certain that even she must recognize the hollowness
of his protestations. But she never doubted
him; she accepted the dull, leaden note of his spurious
passion for the clear ring of unalloyed and
fine gold.</p>
<p>Suddenly and unexpectedly she released herself
from his arms. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; she exclaimed, in conscience-stricken
tones, &#8220;Mrs. Caley&#8217;s medicine! I&mdash;forgot;
she should have had some long ago.&#8221; He
tried to catch her once more in his embrace, restrain
her. &#8220;It would be better not to wake her up,&#8221; he
protested, &#8220;sleep&#8217;s what sick folks need.&#8221; But she
continued to evade him. Mrs. Caley must have her
medicine. The doctor had said that it was important.
&#8220;It&#8217;s my duty, Gordon,&#8221; she told him, &#8220;and
you would want me to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stifled with difficulty an impatient exclamation.
&#8220;Then will you come back?&#8221; he queried. He
took her once more close in his arms. &#8220;Come
back,&#8221; he whispered hotly in her ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, dear Gordon, it is so late.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does that matter? don&#8217;t you love me?
You said you were the sort of a girl to give all; and
now, because it is a little late, you are afraid. What
are you afraid of? Tell me that! You know I
love you; we belong to each other; what does it
matter how late it is? Beside, no one will know,
no one is here to spy on us. Come back, my little
girl&nbsp;...&nbsp;my little Lettice; come back to a lonely
man with nothing else in the world but you. I&#8217;ll
come in with you, wait inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she sobbed, &#8220;wait&nbsp;...&nbsp;here. I will see&nbsp;...&nbsp;the
medicine. Wait here for me, I will come
back. It doesn&#8217;t matter how late it is, nothing matters&nbsp;...&nbsp;trust
in you. Love makes everything
good. Only you love me, oh, truly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Truly,&#8221; he reassured her. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be long; and,
remember, shut Mrs. Caley&#8217;s door.&#8221;</p>
<p>She left him abruptly, and, standing alone in the
dark, he cursed himself for a fool for letting her
go&mdash;a boy&#8217;s trick. But then the whole affair did
not desperately engage him. He sat in the comfortable
chair, and lit a cigarette, shielding it with
his hand so that she would not see it, recognize in
its triviality his detachment. A wave of weariness
swept over him; the night was like a blanket on
the land. Minutes passed without her return; soon
he would go in search of her; he would find her&nbsp;...&nbsp;in
the dark house.... He shut his eyes for a
moment, and opened them with an effort. The whippoorwills
never for a moment ceased their melancholy
calling; they seemed to draw nearer to him;
then retreat, far away. His head fell forward upon
his breast.</p>
<p>Lettice Hollidew! little fool; but what was that
beyond her, blacker than night?</p>
<p>He stirred, sat up sharply, his eyes dazzled by a
blaze of intolerable brilliancy. It was the sun, a
full two hours above the horizon. He had slept
through the night. His muscles were cramped, his
neck ached intolerably. He rose with a painful effort
and something fell to the floor. It was a rose,
wilted, its fragrance fled. He realized that Lettice
had laid it on his knee, last night, when the bud had
been fresh. He had slept while she stood above
him, while the rose had faded. On the step the fish
lay, no longer brightly colored, in a dull, stiff heap.
The house was still; through the open door the sun
fell on a strip of rag rug. He turned and hurried
down the steps, unlatched the gate, and almost ran
across the fields to the cover of a wood, fleeing from
an unsupportably humiliating vision.</p>

<p>He made his way to where Greenstream village
lay somnolent beneath the refulgent
day. The chairs before the office of the
<i>Bugle</i> were unoccupied, from within came the monotonous,
sliding rattle of the small footpress. Gordon
sat absently revolving the possibilities held out
by the near future. Hay, he knew was still being
made in the valley, but the prospect of long, arduous,
days in the open fields, in the hot, dry chaff of the
sere grass, was forbidding. He might take his gun
and a few personal necessities and disappear into
such wild as yet remained, contracting steadily before
the inexorable, smooth advance of civilization. He
was aware that he could manage a degree of comfort,
adequate food. But the thoughtless resiliency of
sheer youth had deserted him, the desire for mere,
picturesque adventure had fled during the past, comfortable
years. He dismissed contemptuously the
possibility of clerking in a local store. There was
that still in the Makimmon blood which balked at
measuring ribbands, selling calico to captious
women.</p>
<p>The large, suave figure of the Universalist minister,
in grey alpaca coat and black trousers, approached
leisurely over the street, and stopped before
Gordon. The minister had a conspicuously
well-fed paunch, his smooth face expressed placid
self-approval, his tones never for a moment lost the
unctuous echo of the pulpiteer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have not worshipped with us lately,&#8221; he observed.
&#8220;Remiss, remiss. Our services have been
stirring&mdash;three souls redeemed from everlasting torment
at the Wednesday meeting, two adults and a
child sealed to Christ on Sunday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll drop in,&#8221; Gordon told him pacifically.</p>
<p>&#8220;A casual phrase to apply to the Mansion of the
Son,&#8221; the minister observed, &#8220;more humility would
become you.... God, I pray Thee that Thy fire
descend upon this unhappy man and consume utterly
away his carnal envelope. What are you doing?&#8221;
he demanded abruptly of Gordon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing particular just now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some small occupations about the
parsonage&mdash;a board or so loose on the ice house,
a small field of provender for the animal. Let us
say a week&#8217;s employment for a ready man. I could
pay but a modest stipend&nbsp;...&nbsp;but the privilege of
my home, the close communion with our Maker.
You would be as my brother: what do you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon was well aware of the probable extent
of the &#8220;small occupations,&#8221; the minister&#8217;s reputation
for exacting monumental labors in return for the
&#8220;modest stipend&#8221; mentioned. However, the proposal
furnished Gordon with a solution for immediate
difficulties; it secured him a bed and food, an
opportunity for the maturing of further plans.</p>
<p>He rose, queried, &#8220;Shall I go right along?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Admirable,&#8221; the other approved. &#8220;My beloved
helpmate will show you where the tools are
kept, when you can begin immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon made his way past Simmons&#8217; store to the
plaster bulk of the Universalist Church, its lawn
shared by the four-square, shingled roof of the parsonage.
Back of both structures reached a small
field of heavy grass, where Gordon labored for the
remainder of the day.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon an aged, gaunt man drove
an incongruous, two wheeled, breaking cart into the
stable yard behind the parsonage. After hitching
an aged, gaunt white horse, he approached the field&#8217;s
edge, where Gordon was harvesting. It was the
minister&#8217;s father-in-law, himself a clergyman for
the half century past, a half century that stretched
back into strenuous, bygone days of circuit riding.
His flowing hair and a ragged goatee were white,
oddly stained and dappled with lemon yellow, his
skin was leather-like from years of exposure to the
elements, to the bitter mountain winters, the
ruthless suns of the August valleys. He was as seasoned,
as tough, as choice old hickory, and had pale,
blue eyes in which the flame of religious fervor, of
incandescent zeal, were scarcely dimmed.</p>
<p>A long supper table was spread in a room where a
sideboard supported a huge silver-plated pitcher
swung on elaborately engraved supports, a dozen
blue glasses traced with gold, and a plate that pictured
in a grey, blurred fashion the Last Supper.
The gathering ranged variously from the aged circuit
rider to the minister&#8217;s next but one to the youngest:
he had fourteen children, of which nine were
ravenously present. The oldest girl at the table, a
possible sixteen years, had this defiant detachment
under her immediate charge, acquitting herself notably
by a constant stream of sharp negations opposed
to a varied clamor of proposals, attempted forages
upon the heaped plates, sly reprisals, and a
sustained, hysterical note which threatened at any
time, and in any youthful individual, to burst into
angry wails.</p>
<p>Opposite Gordon Makimmon sat a slight, feminine
figure, whom he recognized as the teacher of the
past season&#8217;s local school. She had a pallid face,
which she rarely raised, compressed lips, and hands
which attracted Gordon by reason of their white deftness,
the precise charm of their pointed fingers.
During a seemingly interminable grace, pronounced
in a rapid sing-song by the circuit rider, Gordon saw
her flash her gaze about the table, the room; and its
somber, resentful fire, its restrained fury of impatience,
of disdain, of hatred, coming from that fragile,
silent shape, startled him.</p>
<p>The Universalist minister addressed the company
in sonorous periods, which, however, did not
prevent him from assimilating a prodigious amount
of food. Between forkfuls of chicken baked in macaroni,
&#8220;I rejoice that my ministrations are acceptable
to Him,&#8221; he pronounced; &#8220;three souls Wednesday
last, two adults and a child on Sunday.&#8221;</p>
<p>The aged evangelist could scarcely contain his
contempt at this meager tally. &#8220;What would you
say, Augustus,&#8221; he demanded in eager, tremulous
triumph, &#8220;to two hundred lost souls roaring up to
the altar, casting off their wickedness like snakes
shed their skins? Hey? Hey? What would you
say to two hundred dipped in the blood of the lamb
and emerging white as the Dove? Souls ain&#8217;t what
they were,&#8221; he muttered pessimistically; &#8220;it used to
be you could hear the Redeemed a spell of miles
from the church, now they&#8217;re as confidential as a
man borrowing money. The Lord will in no wise
acknowledge the faint in spirit.&#8221; Suddenly,
&#8220;Glory! Glory!&#8221; he shouted, and his old eyes
flamed with the inextinguishable blaze of his
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The minister&#8217;s wife inserted in the door from the
kitchen a face bright red from bending over the stove.
&#8220;Now, pa,&#8221; she admonished, &#8220;you&#8217;ll scare them
children again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;board or so&#8221; to be replaced on the ice
house, as Gordon had surmised, proved to
be extensive&mdash;a large section of the inner
wall had rotted from the constant dampness, the
slowly seeping water. The ice house stood back of
the dwelling, by the side of the small barn and beyond
a number of apple trees: it was a square structure
of boards, with no opening save a low door
under the peak of the roof with a small platform
and exterior flight of steps.</p>
<p>In the gloomy, dank interior a rough ladder, fastened
to the wall, led down to the falling level of
soggy sawdust, embedded in which the irregular
pieces of ice were preserved against the summer.
From the interior the opening made a vivid square
of blue sky; for long hours the blue increased in
brilliancy, after which, veiled in a greyer haze of
heat, the patch of sky grew gradually paler, and
then clear; the suggestion of immeasurable space
deepened; above the dark hole of the ice house the
illimitable distance was appalling. Gordon was
resting from the sullen, muffled knocking of his hammer
when a figure suddenly blotted out the light, hid
the sky. He recognized the sharply-cut silhouette
of the school-teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a horrid, spooky place,&#8221; she spoke with
a shiver, peering within.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cool,&#8221; Gordon told her indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;And quiet,&#8221; she added, seating herself upon the
platform with an elbow in the opening; &#8220;there&#8217;s none
of the bothersome clatter of a lot of detestable children.&#8221;
She raised her voice in shrill mimicry,
&#8220;&#8216;Teacher, kin I be excused? Teacher!...
Teacher&mdash;!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like children?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I loathe them,&#8221; she shot at him, out of the depths
of a profound, long-accumulated exasperation; &#8220;the
muddy little beasts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I wouldn&#8217;t be vexed with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like nailing boards in a rotten ice
house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m dog poor; I&#8217;ve got to take anything
that comes along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, you fool, do you suppose I&#8217;d be here if I
had anything at all? Do you suppose I&#8217;d stay in
this damn lost hole if I could get anywhere else?
Do you think I have no more possibilities than
this?&#8221;</p>
<p>He mounted the ladder, and emerged upon the
platform by her side, where he found a place, a
minute, for a cigarette.</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s face was bitter, her body tense.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll grow old and die in places like this,&#8221; she
continued passionately; &#8220;I&#8217;ll grow old and die in
pokey, little schools, and wear prim calico dresses,
with a remade old white mull for commencements.
I&#8217;ll never hear anything but twice two, and Persia
is bounded on the north by,&mdash;with all the world
beyond, Paris and London and Egypt, for the lucky.
I want to live,&#8221; she cried to Gordon Makimmon,
idly curious, to the still branches of the apple trees,
the vista of village half-hid in dusty foliage. &#8220;I
want to see things, things different, not these dumb,
depressing mountains. I want to see life!&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon had a swift memory of a city street grey
in a reddening flood of dawn, of his own voice in a
reddening flood of dawn, of his own voice mumbling
out of an overwhelming, nauseous desperation
that same determination, desire. &#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; he
ventured, &#8220;you wouldn&#8217;t think so much of it when
you&#8217;d seen it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221; she exclaimed; &#8220;oh, wouldn&#8217;t I?&mdash;smart
crowds and gay streets and shops on fire
with jewels. That&#8217;s where I belong; I&#8217;d show them;
I&#8217;ve got a style, if I only had a chance! I&#8217;ve got a
figure&nbsp;...&nbsp;shoulders.&#8221;</p>
<p>He appraised in a veiled glance her physical pretensions.
He discovered, to his surprise, that she
had &#8220;shoulders&#8221;; her body resembled her hands, it
was smoothly rounded, provocative; its graceful proportion
deceived the casual eye.</p>
<p>With a disdainful motion she kicked off a heavily
clumsy slipper&mdash;her instep arched narrowly to a
delicate ankle, the small heel was sharply cut. &#8220;In
silk,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and a little brocaded slipper, you
would see.&#8221; She replaced the inadequate thing of
leather. The animation died from her countenance,
she surveyed him with cold eyes, narrowed
lips. Her gaze, he felt, included him in the immediate,
hateful scene; she gained fresh repugnance
from his stained, collarless shirt, his bagging knees
coated with sawdust.</p>
<p>She rose, and, her skirt gathered in one hand, descended
the precarious flight of steps. She crossed
the grass slowly, her head bent, her hands tightly
clenched.</p>
<p>Later, in the yard, Gordon saw, at a lighted,
upper window, the silhouette of her back, a gleam
of white arm. The window cast an elongated rectangle
of warm light on the blue gloom of the grass.
It illuminated him, with his gaze lifted; and, while,
standing in the open window, she saw him clearly,
she was as indifferent, as contemptuous of his presence,
as though he had been an animal. A film
of cambric, golden in the lamplight, settled about
her smooth shoulders, fell in long diaphanous lines.
She raised her arms to her head, her hair slid darkly
across her face, and she turned and disappeared.
He moved away, but the memory rankled delicately
in his imagination, returned the following morning.
The thought lingered of that body, as fine as
ivory, unguessed, hidden, in a coarse sheath.</p>

<h2>XXVII</h2>
</div>

<p>His miscellaneous labors at the minister&#8217;s
filled nearly a week of unremitting labor.
But, upon the advent of Sunday,
mundane affairs were suspended in the general confusion
of preparation for church. It had rained
during the night, the day was cool and fragrant and
clear, and Gordon determined to evade the morning&#8217;s
services, and plunge aimlessly into the pleasant
fields. He kept in the background until the cavalcade
had started, headed by the minister&mdash;the circuit
rider had driven off earlier in his cart to an
outlying chapel&mdash;and his wife. It was inviting
on the deserted veranda, and Gordon lingered while
the village emptied into the churches, the open.</p>
<p>Finally he sauntered over the street, past the
Courthouse, by Pompey Hollidew&#8217;s residence. It
was, unlike the surrounding dwellings, built of
brick; there was no porch, only three stone steps descending
from the main entrance, and no flowers.
The path was overgrown with weeds, the front shutters
were indifferently flung back, half opened,
closed. The door stood wide open, and, as he
passed, Gordon gathered the impression of a dark
heap on the hall floor. He dismissed an idle curiosity;
and then, for no discoverable reason, halted,
turned back, for a second glance.</p>
<p>Even from the path he saw extending from the
heap an arm, a gnarled hand. It was Pompey Hollidew
himself, cold, still, on the floor. Gordon
entered, looking outside for assistance: no one was
in sight. Pompey Hollidew wore the familiar,
greenish-black coat, the thread-bare trousers and
faded, yellow shirt. The battered derby had rolled
a short distance across the floor. The dead man&#8217;s
face was a congested, olive shade, with purple
smudges beneath the up-rolled eyes, and lips like
dried leaves. His end, it was apparent, had been
as sudden as it was natural.</p>
<p>Old Pompey&nbsp;...&nbsp;dead! Gordon straightened
up. Simultaneously two ideas flashed into his
mind&mdash;Lettice and Hollidew&#8217;s gold. Then they
grew coherent, explicable. Lettice and the gold
were one; she was the gold, the gold was Lettice.
He recalled now, appositely, what Bartamon had
told him but a few days before&nbsp;...&nbsp;Hollidew
would consent to make no will; there were no other
children. The money would automatically go,
principally, to Lettice, without question or contest.
If he had but considered before, acted with ordinary
sense&nbsp;...&nbsp;the girl had been in love with him;
he might have had it all. He gazed cautiously, but
with no determined plan of action, out over the
street&mdash;it lay deserted in the ambient sunlight.</p>
<p>He quickly left the house, the old man sprawling
grotesquely across the bare hall, forcing himself to
walk with an assumed, deliberate ease over the plank
walk, past Simmons&#8217; corner. As he progressed a
plan formulated in his mind, a plan obvious, promising
immediate, practicable results&nbsp;...&nbsp;Lettice
had told him that she would remain for two weeks
at the farm. It was evident that she was still there.
His gait quickened; if he could reach her now, before
any one else.... He wished that he had
closed the door upon the old man&#8217;s body; any one
passing as he had passed could see the corpse; a
wagon would be sent for the girl.</p>
<p>He commenced, outside the village, to run, pounding
over the dusty way with long-drawn, painful
gasps, his chest oppressed by the now unaccustomed
exercise, the rapid motion. When he came in sight
of the farmhouse that was his objective, he stopped
and endeavored to remove all traces of his haste; he
rubbed off his shoes, fingered his necktie, mopped his
brow.</p>
<p>There was a woman on the porch; it proved to be
Mrs. Caley, folded in a shawl, pale and gaunt.
Suddenly the possibility occurred to him that Lettice
had driven into church. But she was in the
garden patch beyond, Mrs. Caley said. Gordon
strolled around the corner of the house as hastily, as
slowly, as he dared.</p>
<p>He saw her immediately. She wore a blue linen
skirt, a white waist, and her sleeves were rolled up.
The sun glinted on her uncovered hair, blazed in the
bright tin basin into which she was dropping scarlet
peppers. She appeared younger than he had remembered
her; her arms were youthful and softly
dimpled; her brow seemed again the calm, guileless
brow of a girl; her eyes, as she raised them in
greeting, were serene.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to explain to you,&#8221; he began obliquely,
&#8220;about that&mdash;that falling asleep. It&#8217;s been worrying
me. You see, I hadn&#8217;t had any rest for three
or four nights, I had been bothering about my affairs,
and about something more important still.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bean poles, covered with bright green verdure,
made a background of young summer for her own
promise of early maturity. She placed the basin
on the ground, and stood with her arms hanging
loosely, gazing at him expectantly, frankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most important thing in my life,&#8221; he added,
then paused. &#8220;I thought for a while that I had
better go away without saying anything to you, and
more particularly since I have lost everything.&#8221;
He could hear, coming over the road, the regular
hoof-beats of a trotting horse, and he had the
feeling that it must be a messenger from the village, dispatched
in search of Lettice with the news of her
father&#8217;s death. For a moment the horse seemed to
be stopping; he was afraid that his opportunity had
been lost; but, after all, the hoof-beats passed, diminished
over the road. Then, &#8220;Since I have lost
everything,&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please tell me more,&#8221; she demanded, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
understand&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; he continued, in the manner he had hastily
adopted, &#8220;when the time came I couldn&#8217;t; I couldn&#8217;t
go away and leave you. I thought, perhaps, you
might be different from others; I thought, perhaps,
you might like a man for what he was, and not for
what he had. I would come to you, I decided, and
tell you all this, tell you that I could work, yes, and
would, and make enough&mdash;&#8221; He paused in order
to observe the effect of his speech upon her. She
was gazing clear-eyed at him, in a sort of shining
expectancy, a grave, eager comprehension, appealing,
incongruous, to her girlhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221; she queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m in love with you: I want to marry
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her gaze did not falter, but her color changed
swiftly, a rosy tide swept over her cheeks, and died
away, leaving her pale. Her lips trembled. A palpable,
radiant content settled upon her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she told him seriously; &#8220;it will
make me very happy to marry you, Gordon.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a fleeting, backward glance he moved closer
to her, his arm fell about her waist, he pressed a
hasty, ill-directed kiss upon her chin. &#8220;Will you
marry me now?&#8221; he asked eagerly. &#8220;You see, others
wouldn&#8217;t understand, you remember what your
father said about the Makimmon breed? They
would repeat that I had nothing, or even that I was
marrying you for old Pompey&#8217;s money. You know
better than that, you know he wouldn&#8217;t give us a
penny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t matter now what any one said,&#8221; she
returned serenely.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it would be so much easier&mdash;we could slip
off quietly somewhere, and come back married, all
the fuss avoided, all the say so&#8217;s and say no&#8217;s shut
up right at the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When do you want to be&mdash;be married?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right away! now! to-day!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&nbsp;...&nbsp;oh, Gordon, but we couldn&#8217;t! I
haven&#8217;t even a white dress here. I might go into
Greenstream, be ready to-morrow&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, no, I&#8217;m afraid it must be now or never;
something would take you from me. I knew it, I
was afraid of it, from the first&nbsp;...&nbsp;I&#8217;ll shoot myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>She started toward him in an excess of tender pity.
&#8220;Do you care as much as that?&#8221; She laid her
palms upon his shoulders, lifting her face to his:
&#8220;Then we will do what you say, we will go, yes, we
will go immediately. You can hitch up the buggy,
while I get a little thing or two. I have my beads,
and the bracelets that were mother&#8217;s&nbsp;...&nbsp;I wish
my white organdie was here. You mustn&#8217;t think
I&#8217;m silly! You see&mdash;marriage, for a girl&nbsp;...&nbsp;I
thought it would all be so different. But, Gordon
dear, we won&#8217;t let you be unhappy.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wished silently to God that she would get the
stuff in the house, that they would get started. At
any minute now word would come of the old man&#8217;s
death, there would be delay, Lettice would learn that
he had lied again and again to her. With a gesture
of impatience he dislodged her hands from his
shoulders. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Sim?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the long field. I&#8217;ll show you the stable; it
won&#8217;t take me a minute to get ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hitched, in an incredibly short space of time,
a tall, ungainly roan horse into the buggy; his practised
hands connected the straps, settled the headstall,
the collar, as if by magic. He stood in a fever
of uneasiness at the harnessed head. Lettice was
longer than she had indicated.</p>
<p>When, at last, she appeared, she carried a neatly
pinned paper bundle, and a fragrant mass of hastily
pulled roses. Bright blue glass beads hung over the
soft contours of her virginal breasts, the bracelets
that had been her mother&#8217;s&mdash;enamelled in black on
old, reddish gold&mdash;encircled her smooth wrists.</p>
<p>He would have hurried her at once into the buggy,
but she stopped him, and stood facing him with level,
solemn eyes:</p>
<p>&#8220;I give myself to you, Gordon,&#8221; she said, &#8220;gladly
and gladly, and I will go wherever you go, and
try all my life to be what you would like.&#8221; As she
repeated her simple words, erect and brave, with her
arms filled with roses, for a fleeting second he was
again conscious of the vague menace that had towered
darkly at her back on the night when she had
laid in his grasp that other rose&nbsp;...&nbsp;the rose that
had faded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get along,&#8221; he urged. The whip swung
out across the roan&#8217;s ears, and the horse started forward
with a vicious rush. The dewy fragrance of
the flowers trailed out behind the buggy, mingling
with the swirling dust, then both settled into the
empty road, under the burning brightness of the
sun, the insensate beauty of the azure sky.</p>

<p>In the clear glow of a lengthening twilight of
spring Gordon Makimmon sauntered into Simmons&#8217;
store. The high, dusty windows facing
the Courthouse were raised, and a warm air drifted
in, faint eddies of the fragrance of flowering bushes,
languorous draughts of a countryside newly green.</p>
<p>A number of men idling over a counter greeted
him with a familiar and instantly alert curiosity.
The clerk behind the counter bent forward with
the brisk assumption of a business-like air. &#8220;Certainly,&#8221;
Gordon replied to his query, pausing to
allow his purpose to gain its full effect; &#8220;I want to
order a suit of clothes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, damn it t&#8217;ell, Gord!&#8221; exclaimed an individual,
with a long, drooping nose, a jaw which hung
loosely on a corded, bare throat; &#8220;it ain&#8217;t three weeks
ago but you got a suit, and it ain&#8217;t the one you have
on now, neither.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up, Tol&#8217;able,&#8221; Buckley Simmons interposed,
&#8220;you&#8217;ll hurt trade. Gordon&#8217;s the Dandy
Dick of Greenstream.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t I a right to as many suits of clothes
as I&#8217;ve a mind to?&#8221; Gordon demanded belligerently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure you have, Gord. You certainly have,&#8221; a
pacific chorus replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want one like the last drummer wore through
here,&#8221; he continued; &#8220;a check suit with braid on all
the edges.&#8221;</p>
<p>The clerk dropped a bulky volume heavily on the
counter. &#8220;The Chicago Sartorial Company,&#8221; he
asserted, &#8220;have got some swell checks.&#8221; He ran
hastily over the pages, each with a sample rectangle
of cloth pasted within a printed gold border, and a
cabalistic sign beneath. Finally, &#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; he
demanded, indicating a bold, mathematical design
in pale orange, blue and grey.</p>
<p>A combined whistle rose from the onlookers;
comments of mock amazement crowded one upon another.
&#8220;Jin&nbsp;...&nbsp;go! He&#8217;s got the wrong book&mdash;that&#8217;s
rag carpet. Don&#8217;t look at it too long, Gord,
it&#8217;ll cross your eyes. That ain&#8217;t a suit, it&#8217;s a game.&#8221;
A gaunt hand solemnly shook out imaginary dice
upon the counter, &#8220;It&#8217;s my move and I can jump
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen! gentlemen!&#8221; the clerk protested;
&#8220;this is the finest article woven, the very toniest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon dismissed the sample with a gesture.
&#8220;I&#8217;m a man,&#8221; he pronounced, &#8220;not a minstrel.&#8221; His
attention was held by a smaller pattern, in black
and white, with an occasional red thread drawn
through. &#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; he decided; &#8220;that&#8217;s it, with
braid. What will that damage me?&#8221;</p>
<p>The clerk consulted the sign appended to the
sample, then raced through a smaller, supplementary
volume, where he located the item in question.
&#8220;That cloth you picked out,&#8221; he announced importantly,
&#8220;is one of the best the Chicago Sartorial
Company put out. Cut ample, with sleeves lined
in silkaleen and back in A1 mohair, it&#8217;ll stand you
thirty-eight dollars. Genuine Eytalian thread silk
lining will come at four and a half more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll do,&#8221; Gordon told him, &#8220;with the silk and
the braid edge.&#8221;</p>
<p>The clerk noted the order; then with a tape measure
affixed to a slim, wooden angle, came from
behind the counter. &#8220;Remove the coat, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon, with a patent self-consciousness, took off
his coat, revealing a flimsy white silk shirt striped
like a child&#8217;s stick of candy in vivid green.</p>
<p>The whistle arose with renewed force; gnarled
and blackened fingers gingerly felt the shirt&#8217;s
texture. &#8220;Man dear! The lily of Lebanon.
Arrayed like a regular prostitute&nbsp;...&nbsp;silk shirt
tails.&#8221;</p>
<p>The clerk skilfully conducted a series of measurements,
noting results on a printed form; outer and
inner seams were tallied, chest and thigh and knee
recorded, the elbow crooked. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget his
teeth,&#8221; the clerk was admonished; &#8220;remember the
braid on the pants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon resumed his coat, the clerk returned the
books to their shelf, and the factitious excitement
subsided. The light faded, the depths of the store
swam in blue obscurity, but the fragrance of the
spring dusk had deepened.</p>
<p>&#8220;When are you going to get the dog, Gord?&#8221;
Tol&#8217;able asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;What dog?&#8221; another interposed curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, ain&#8217;t you heard about Gord&#8217;s dog,&#8221; the
chorus demanded. &#8220;Where have you been&mdash;up
with the Dutch on the South Fork? Gord&#8217;s got a
dog coming he give two hundred dollars for. Yes,
sir, he paid for a dog, he give real money for a four-legged,
yelping wire-hound. It ain&#8217;t a rabbit dog,
nor a sheep dog, nor even a bull-dog; but just plain,
stinking dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, he did like hell, give two hundred for a
dog!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he did. That&#8217;s right, didn&#8217;t you, Gord?
Two hundred! I saw the cheque. God dam&#8217; if he
didn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon admitted the facts as far as they had been
stated. &#8220;But this dog,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;is different
from the just happen so hounds around here. This
dog has got a pedigree, his parents were united by
the church all regular and highly fashionable. He
ain&#8217;t expected to run rabbits nor mangy sheep; he
just sits on the stoop eating sausages and syrup, and
takes a leg off any low down parties that visit with
him without a collar on. He&#8217;ll be on the Stenton
stage this evening,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I got word last
night he was coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>They lounged to the entrance of the store, gazing
over the still road, in the direction from which the
stage would arrive. Valentine Simmons was in his
office; and, as Gordon passed, he knocked on the
glass of the enclosure, and beckoned the other to
enter.</p>
<p>He greeted Gordon Makimmon cordially, waving
him to a seat. Valentine Simmons never, apparently,
changed; his countenance was always freshly
pink, the tufts of hair above his ears like combed
lamb&#8217;s wool; his shirt with its single, visible blue
button never lacked its immaculate gloss.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re looking as jaunty as a man should with
the choice of the land before him. Lucky! lucky!
charming little wife, large fortune at your disposal....
Pompey left one of the solidest estates in this
section. Opportune for you, very&nbsp;...&nbsp;miraculous,
if I may say so. But there, you ornament the
money as well as any other. You are right too&mdash;a
free hand; yours is the time for liberality, no
cares&mdash;they come later. Ah, Gordon, have you
examined the details of your late father-in-law&#8217;s
property? Have you searched through all the
items, made yourself familiar with all the&mdash;er,
petty and laborious details?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not just yet, I have been intending&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Simmons stopped him with an upraised palm.
&#8220;No more, I understand your thought exactly. It&#8217;s
a tiresome business. Yours is the time for liberality,
no cares. However, I had a slight knowledge
of Pompey Hollidew&#8217;s arrangements. He was accustomed
to discussing them with me. He liked my
judgment in certain little matters; and, in that way,
I got a general idea of his enterprises. He was a
great hand for timber, your father-in-law; against
weighty advice at the time of his death he was buying
timber options here and there in the valley.
Though what he wanted with them&nbsp;...&nbsp;beyond
ordinary foresight.&mdash;No transportation, you see; no
railroad nor way of getting lumber out. But then,
he had some visionary scheme or other. He held
some thousand acres, most of it bought at a nominal
figure. No good to anybody now; but I have got
the timber fever myself&mdash;something may turn up
in the far future, perhaps in another generation....
What would you say to a flat eight dollars an
acre for the options, the money banked right to your
credit? A neat little sum for current pleasures.
Ah&mdash;&#8221; in spite of himself, Valentine Simmons
became grave at the contemplation of the amount involved.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t say I would take all, but the best,
certainly the greater part.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Gordon spoke slowly from
an old-time suspicion of the other. &#8220;It&#8217;s my wife&#8217;s
property.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But such a dutiful little wife&mdash;the husband&#8217;s
word. Remember, the money in your hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly sounds all right. Lettice would
have the cash to show. I&#8217;ll speak to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better not delay. There are other options;
owners are glad to sell. I have given you the privilege
first&mdash;old friend, old Presbyterian friend. The
time is necessarily limited.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he mentally revolved the proposal Gordon
could find no palpable objection: the options, the
timber, was obviously standing fallow, with no
means of transportation to a market, in exchange for
ready money. Lettice would easily see the sense in
the deal; besides, he had brought in her name only
for form&#8217;s sake&mdash;he, Gordon Makimmon, held the
deciding vote in the affairs of his home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t rightly see anything against it,&#8221; he admitted
finally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; Simmons declared with satisfaction;
&#8220;an able man, you can see as far as the next through
a transaction. I&#8217;ll have the county clerk go over
the options, bring you the result in a couple of weeks.
Don&#8217;t disturb yourself; yours is the time for pleasures,
not papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Gord!&#8221; a voice called thinly from without;
&#8220;here&#8217;s your dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon rose and made his way to the platform
before the store, where the Stenton stage had
stopped. A seat had been removed from the surrey,
its place taken by a large box with a square opening,
covered with heavy wire net at one end, and a board
fitted movably in grooves at the other. There were
mutters incredulous, ironic, from the awaiting group
of men; envy was perceptible, bitterness &#8220;... for
a dog. Two hundred! Old Pompey hollered out
of the dirt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There he is, Gord,&#8221; the driver proclaimed; &#8220;and
fetching that dog palace&#8217;ll cost you seventy-five
cents.&#8221; The box was shifted to the platform; and,
while Gordon unfastened the slide, the men gathered
in a curious, mocking circle.</p>
<p>The slide was raised, the box sharply tilted, and
a grotesquely clumsy and grave young dog slid out.
There was a hoarse uproar of gibing laughter, backs
and knees were slapped, heavy feet stamped. The
dog stood puzzled by the tumult: he had a long,
square, shaggy head, the color of ripe wheat; clear,
dark eyes and powerful jaw; his body was narrow,
covered with straight, wiry black hair; a short tail
was half raised, tentative; and his wheat colored
legs were ludicrously, inappropriately, long and
heavy.</p>
<p>He stood patiently awaiting, evidently, some familiar
note, some reassuring command, in that unintelligible
human clamor. Gordon regarded him
through half-closed, indifferent eyes. &#8220;Here, doggy,&#8221;
a hoarse, persuasive voice called; a hand was
stretched out to him. But, as he reached it, &#8220;Two
hundred dollars!&#8221; the voice exclaimed, and the hand
gave the animal a quick, unexpected thrust. The
dog sprawled back, and fell on the point of his
shoulder. He rose swiftly to his feet without a
whimper, standing once more at a loss in the midst
of the inexplicable animosity. He watched them all
intently, with wrinkles in his serious young brow.
When, from behind, another hand thrust him
sharply upon his jaw, he rose as quickly as possible,
swaying a little upon the inappropriate legs. Another
suddenly knocked his hind legs from under
him, and he sat heavily upon his haunches. The
laughter ran renewed about the circle.</p>
<p>The sum of money that had been expended upon
that single dog&mdash;a dog even that could neither hunt
rabbits nor herd sheep&mdash;had, it appeared, engendered
a bitter animosity, a personal spite, in the
hearts of the men on the store platform. They
were men to whom two hundred dollars was the
symbol of arduous months of toil, endless days of
precariously rewarded labor with the stubborn, inimical
forces of nature, with swamp and rock and
thicket. Two hundred dollars! It was the price
of a roof, of health, of life itself.</p>
<p>A hard palm swung upon the dog&#8217;s ribs, and, in
instant response, he fell upon his side. He rose
more slowly; stood isolated, obviously troubled.
He drew back stumbling from a menacing gesture;
but there was no cringing visible in his immature, ill-proportioned
body; his tail drooped, but from weariness,
discouragement; his head was level; his eyes
met the circle of eyes about him.</p>
<p>Gordon took no part in the baiting; he lit a cigar,
snapped the match over his shoulder, carelessly
watched his newest acquisition. A heavy, wooden-soled
shoe shoved the dog forward. And Buckley
Simmons, in an obvious improvement upon that
man&oelig;uver, kicked the animal behind the ear. The
forelegs rose with the impact of the blow, and the
body struck full length upon the platform, where it
lay dazed. But, finally, the dog got up insecurely,
wabbling; a dark blot spread slowly across the
straw-colored head.</p>
<p>No one, it was evident, was prepared for the sudden
knifelike menace of Gordon Makimmon&#8217;s voice
as he bent over the dog and wiped the blood upon
his sleeve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kick him again, Buck,&#8221; he said; &#8220;kick him
again and see how funny it&#8217;ll be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Gordon,&#8221; Buckley Simmons protested, &#8220;we
were all stirring him up a little; you didn&#8217;t say anything&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Makimmon picked the dog up, holding him
against his side, the awkward legs streaming down
in an uncomfortable confusion of joints and paws.
&#8220;I paid two hundred dollars for this dog,&#8221; he pronounced,
&#8220;as a piece of dam&#8217; foolishness, a sort of
drunken joke on Greenstream. But it&#8217;s no joke;
the two hundred was cheap. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of good
men&mdash;I&#8217;m not exactly a peafowl myself&mdash;but this
young dog&#8217;s better&#8217;n any man I ever stood up to;
he&#8217;s got more guts.&#8221;</p>
<p>He abruptly turned his back upon the gathering,
and descended to the road, carrying the limp, warm
body all the way home.</p>

</div>

<p>It was his own home to which he returned, the
original dwelling of the Makimmons in Greenstream.
He could not, he had told Lettice, be
comfortable anywhere else; he could not be content
with it closed against the living sound of the stream,
or in strange hands. Some changes had been made
since his marriage&mdash;another space had been enclosed
beyond the kitchen, a chamber occupied by
Sim Caley and his wife, moved from the outlying
farm where Lettice had spent her weeks of &#8220;retreat&#8221;
throughout the passing summers. The exterior
had been painted leaden-grey, and a shed
transformed into a small, serviceable stable. But
the immediate surroundings were the same: the
primitive sweep still rose from the well, a cow still
grazed in the dank grass; the stream slipped by, mirroring
its stable banks, the foliage inexhaustibly replenished
by nature; beyond the narrow valley the
mountain range shut out the rising sun, closed
Greenstream into its deep, verdurous gorge.</p>
<p>High above, the veil of light was still rosy, but it
was dusk about Gordon Makimmon&#8217;s dwelling.
Lettice, in white, with a dark shawl drawn about
her shoulders, was standing on the porch. She
spoke in a strain of querulous sweetness:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gordon, you&#8217;ve been the longest while. Mrs.
Caley says your supper&#8217;s all spoiled. You know
she likes to get the table cleared right early in the
evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Mrs. Caley to have her say in this house or
am I? That&#8217;s what I want to know. Am I to eat
so&#8217;s she can clear the table, or is she to clear the table
when I have had my supper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When it suits you, Gordon, of course. Oh,
Gordon! whatever are you carrying?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A dog!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you wanted a dog.&#8221; An accent
of doubt crept into her voice, a hesitation. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know if I want a dog around&nbsp;...&nbsp;just now, Gordon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t do any harm; he&#8217;s only a young dog,
anyhow. Ain&#8217;t you a young dog, a regular puppy?
But, Lettice, he&#8217;s got the grit of General Jackson;
he stood right up against the crowd at the store.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, Gordon, right now&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you he wouldn&#8217;t do any harm,&#8221; the man
repeated in irritated tones; &#8220;he will be with me most
of the time, and not around the house. You&#8217;re getting
too cranky for living, Lettice.&#8221; He set the dog
upon his feet. &#8220;What I&#8217;ll call him I don&#8217;t know;
he&#8217;s as gritty as&mdash;why, yes, I do, I&#8217;ll call him General
Jackson. C&#8217;m here, General.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dog still wavered slightly. He stood intently
regarding Gordon. &#8220;Here, here, General Jackson.&#8221;
After another long scrutiny he walked slowly up to
Gordon, raised his head toward the man&#8217;s countenance.
Gordon Makimmon was delighted.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a smart dog!&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;smarter&#8217;n
half the people I know. He&#8217;s got to have something
to eat. Lettice, will you tell Mrs. Caley to
give General something to eat, and nothing&#8217;s too
good for him, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lettice walked to the door of the kitchen and
transmitted Gordon&#8217;s request to the invisible Mrs.
Caley. The latter appeared after a moment and
stood gazing somberly at the man and dog. She
was a tall, ungainly woman, with a flat, sexless body
and a deeply-lined face almost the color of her own
salt-raised bread. &#8220;This is General Jackson,&#8221;
Gordon explained out of the settling dark; &#8220;he&#8217;d
thank you for a panful of supper. Come on, General,
come on in the kitchen. No, Mrs. Caley won&#8217;t
bite you; she&#8217;ll give us something to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>The room next to the kitchen, that had been
Clare&#8217;s, had been stripped of its furnishing, and a
glistening yellow pine table set in the middle, with
six painted wood chairs. The table was perpetually
spread on a fringed red or blue cloth; the
center occupied by a large silver-plated castor, its
various rings filled with differently shaped bottles
and shakers. At the end where Lettice sat heavy
white cups and saucers were piled; at Gordon&#8217;s
place a knife and fork were propped up on their
guards. On either side were the plates of Simeon
and Mrs. Caley. Each place boasted a knife and
formidable steel fork&mdash;the spoons were assembled
in a glass receptacle&mdash;and a napkin thrust into a
ring of plaited hair plainly marked with the sign of
the respective owner.</p>
<p>Mrs. Caley silently put before Gordon a pinkish
loin of pork, boiled potatoes and a bowl of purple,
swimming huckleberries; this she fortified by a vessel
of gravy and section of pie. There was tea.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s Lettice?&#8221; Gordon demanded. Apparently
Mrs. Caley had not heard him. &#8220;Lettice,&#8221; he
raised his voice; &#8220;here&#8217;s supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want anything to eat, thank you, Gordon,&#8221;
she returned from another room.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to eat,&#8221; he called back, attacking the
pork. Then he muttered, &#8220;&mdash;full of ideas and airs.
Soft.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>Beyond the dining room was their bedroom,
and beyond that a chamber which, for years
in a state of deserted, semi-ruin, Gordon
had had newly floored and rendered weather-proof,
and now used as a place of assemblage. He found
Lettice there when he had finished supper.</p>
<p>She was sitting beside a small table which held a
lighted lamp with a shade of minute, woven pieces
of various silks. Behind her was a cottage organ,
a mass of fretted woodwork; a wall pierced by a
window was ornamented by a framed photograph
of a woman dead and in her coffin. The photograph
had faded to a silvery monotony, but the details
of the rigid, unnatural countenance, the fixed
staring eyes, were still clear. Redly varnished
chairs with green plush cushions and elaborate,
thread antimacassars, a second table ranged against
the wall, bearing a stout volume entitled &#8220;A Cloud
of Witnesses,&#8221; and a cheap phonograph, completed
the furnishing.</p>
<p>It was warm without, but Lettice had shut the
window, the shawl was still about her shoulders.
She was sewing upon a small piece of white material.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, General, here,&#8221; Gordon commanded, and
the dog followed him seriously into the room. &#8220;Pat
him, Lettice, so&#8217;s he&#8217;ll get to know you,&#8221; he urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I want to,&#8221; she began; but, at her
husband&#8217;s obvious impatience, she experimented
doubtfully, &#8220;Here, puppy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you call him by his name?&#8221; he interrupted.
&#8220;How ever&#8217;ll he come to know it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to call him at all,&#8221; she protested,
a little wildly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like him to-night; perhaps
to-morrow I will feel different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, do or don&#8217;t, that dog&#8217;s a part of the house,
and I don&#8217;t want to hear Mrs. Caley say this or that
about it, neither.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Caley isn&#8217;t as bad as you make her out;
it&#8217;s me she&#8217;s thinking about most of the time. I tell
her men are not like women, they never think about
the little things we do. Father was like that&nbsp;...&nbsp;you
are too. That&#8217;s all the men I have known.&#8221;
Her voice trailed off into an abrupt silence, she sat
staring into the room with the needlework forgotten
in her hand.</p>
<p>Gordon turned to the dog, playing with him, pulling
his ears. General Jackson, in remonstrance,
softly bit Gordon&#8217;s hand. &#8220;That&#8217;s a dandy dog.
Making yourself right at home, hey! Biting right
back, are you! Let me feel your teeth, phew&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gordon,&#8221; Lettice exclaimed suddenly in a
throaty voice, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid.... Tell me it will be
all right, Gordon.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked up from the dog, startled by the unaccustomed
vibration of her tones. &#8220;Of course it
will be all right,&#8221; he reassured her hastily, making
an effort to keep his impatience from his voice; &#8220;I
never guessed you were so easy scared.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try not,&#8221; she returned obediently. &#8220;Mrs.
Caley says it will be all right, too.&#8221; She seemed,
he thought, even younger than when he had married
her. She was absurdly girlish. It annoyed him;
it seemed, unjustly, to place too great a demand
upon his forbearance, his patience. A wife should
be able to give and take&mdash;this was almost like having
a child to tend. Lately she had been frightened
even at the dark, she had wakened him over nothing
at all, fancies.</p>
<p>He decided to pay no further attention to her
imagining; and moved to the phonograph, where he
selected one of a small number of waxy cylinders.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll see how the General likes music,&#8221; he proclaimed.
He slipped the cylinder over a projection,
and wound the mechanism. A sharp, high scratching
responded, as painful as a pin dragging over the
ear drum, a meaningless cacophony of sounds that
gradually resolved into a thin, incredibly metallic
melody which appeared, mercifully, to come from
a distance. To this was presently joined a voice,
the voice, as it were, of a sinister, tin manikin galvanized
into convulsive song. The words grew
audible in broken phrases:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>...&nbsp; was a lucky man,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Rip van Winkle&nbsp;...&nbsp;grummmble</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>...&nbsp; never saw the women</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>At Coney Island swimming&nbsp;...</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>General Jackson sat abruptly on his haunches,
and lifted a long, quavering protest. As the cylinder
went round and round, and the shrill performance
continued, the dog&#8217;s howling grew wilder; it
reached a point where it broke into a hoarse cough,
then again it recommenced lower in the scale, carrying
over a gamut of indescribable, audible misery.</p>
<p>Gordon slapped his leg in acute enjoyment. &#8220;The
General&#8217;s a regular opera singer, a high-rolling canary.
Go after it&nbsp;...&nbsp;a regular concert dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gordon,&#8221; Lettice said, in a small, strained
voice. Apparently he had not heard her. &#8220;Gordon,&#8221;
she repeated more loudly. She had dropped
the piece of sewing, her hands were clenched, her face
wet and pallid. &#8220;Gordon!&#8221; she cried, her voice cutting
through the sound of the phonograph and the
howling dog; &#8220;stop it, do you hear! I&#8217;ll go crazy!
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!&#8221;</p>
<p>He silenced the machine in genuine surprise.
&#8220;Why, everything works you up to-night. I thought
you&#8217;d like to hear General Jackson sing; he&#8217;s got
a real deep barytone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lettice sat limply in her chair. &#8220;I stood it just as
long as I could,&#8221; she half whispered.</p>
<p>Gordon walked to the unshuttered window, gazing
out; above the impenetrable, velvety dark of the
western range the stars gleamed like drops of water.
He felt unsettled, ill at ease; dissatisfaction irked
his thoughts and emotions. His unrest was without
tangible features; it permeated him from an undivined
cause, oppressed him with indefinable longing.
He got, he dimly realized, but a limited amount of
satisfaction from the money now at his command.
He was totally without financial instinct&mdash;money
for itself, the abstraction, was beyond his comprehension.
He had bought a ponderous gold watch,
which he continually neglected to wind; the years of
stage driving had sated him of horses; his clothes
were already a subject of jest in Greenstream; and
he had seriously damaged his throat, and the throat
of Sim Caley, with cigars. He had been glad to
return to the familiar, casual cigarettes, the generous
bag of Green Goose for five cents; Sim had reverted
to his haggled plug. He had no desire to build a
pretentious dwelling&mdash;his instinct, his clannish
spirit, was too closely bound up in the house of his
father and grandfather to derive any pleasure from
that.</p>
<p>After he had spent a limited amount, the principal
at his disposal lay untouched, unrealized. He
got a certain measure of content from its sheer bulk
at his back; it ministered to his vanity, to his supreme
self importance. He liked negligently to
produce, in Simmons&#8217; store, a twenty or even fifty
dollar currency note, and then conduct a search
through his pockets for something smaller. He
drank an adequate amount of whiskey, receiving it
in jugs semi-surreptitiously by way of the Stenton
stage; Greenstream County was &#8220;dry,&#8221; but whiskey
in gallons was comparatively inexpensive. He
would have gambled, but two dollars was a momentous
hazard to the habitual card players of the village.
He thought, occasionally, of taking a short
trip, of two or three days, to nearby cities outside
his ken, or to the ocean&mdash;Gordon had never seen a
large body of water; but his life had travelled such
a narrow course, he was so accustomed by blood and
experience to the feel of the mountains, that, when
the moment arrived to consider an actual departure,
he drew back&nbsp;...&nbsp;put it off.</p>
<p>What he was subconsciously longing for was
youth. He was instinctively rebelling, struggling,
against the closing fetters of time, against the dilution
of his blood by time, the hardening of his bones,
the imperceptible slackening of his muscles. His
intimate contact with the vigorous youth of Lettice
had precipitated this rebellion, this strife in which
he was doomed. He would have hotly repudiated
the insinuation that he was growing old; he would
still, perhaps, have fought the man who said that he
was failing. And such a statement would be beside
the fact; no perceptible decay had yet set up at the
heart of his manhood. But the inception of that
process was imminent; the sloth consequent upon
Lettice&#8217;s money was hastening it.</p>
<p>Lettice&#8217;s youthful aspect, persisting in the face of
her approaching motherhood, disconcerted him; it
was inappropriate. Her freshly-flushed, rounded
cheeks beside his own weather-beaten, lean jaw offered
a comment too obvious for enjoyment. He
resented, from his own depleting store, her unspent
sum of days. It created in him an animosity which,
as he turned from the window, noted almost with
relief faint lines about her mouth, the sinking of her
color.</p>
<p>She was sitting with her eyes shut, the sewing
neglected in her lap, and did not see Mrs. Caley
standing in the doorway. The woman&#8217;s gaze lingered
for a moment, with an unmasked, burning contempt,
upon Gordon Makimmon, then swept on to
the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lettice!&#8221; she exclaimed, in a species of exasperated
concern, &#8220;don&#8217;t you know better than to sit
up to all hours?&#8221;</p>

<h2>IV</h2>
</div>

<p>The following morning, &#8220;Oh, Gordon!&#8221; Lettice
cried, &#8220;I like him ever so much; he
played and played with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon had gone to the post-office, and was descending
the slope from the public road to his dwelling.
He found Lettice sitting on the edge of the
porch, and, panting vigorously, the dog extended
before her, an expression of idiotic satisfaction on
his shaggy face. They were, together, an epitome
of extreme youth; and Gordon&#8217;s discontent, revived
from the night before, overflowed in facile displeasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know better than to run him on a
warm morning like this?&#8221; he complained; &#8220;as like
as not now he&#8217;ll take a fit; young dogs mustn&#8217;t get
their blood heated up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The animation died from her countenance, leaving
it almost sullen, her shoulders drooped dejectedly.
&#8220;It seems nothing suits you,&#8221; she observed;
&#8220;you&#8217;re cross when I don&#8217;t like the dog and you&#8217;re
cross when I do. I can&#8217;t satisfy you, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some difference in making over the dog
and playing him out. Come here, General Jackson.&#8221;
The animal rose and yapped, backing playfully
away. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you hear me? Come right
here.&#8221; The dog, sensitive to the growing menace in
the voice, moved still further away. &#8220;C&#8217;m here,
damn you,&#8221; Gordon shot out. The dog grew stubborn,
and refused to move forward; and Gordon, his
anger thoroughly aroused, picked up a large stone
and threw it with all his force, missing General Jackson
by a narrow margin.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; Lettice observed in a studiously
detached voice, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t throw stones at a dog
I had paid two hundred dollars for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon was momentarily disconcerted. He had
not intended to tell Lettice how much the General
had cost. And yet, he reflected, since the village
knew, with Sim Caley&#8217;s wife in the house, it had
been folly to hope to keep it from her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s his pedigree,&#8221; he explained lamely; &#8220;champion
stock, imported.&#8221; His temper again slowly
got the better of his wisdom. &#8220;What if I did pay
two hundred dollars for him?&#8221; he demanded; &#8220;it&#8217;s
harmless, ain&#8217;t it? I&#8217;d a sight better do that than
some other things I might mention.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only said,&#8221; she repeated impersonally, &#8220;that
I would not throw stones at a dog that had cost so
much money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re getting on the money now, are you?
Going to start that song? That&#8217;ll come natural to
you. When I first married you I couldn&#8217;t see how
you were old Pompey&#8217;s daughter, but I might have
known it would come out. I might have known you
weren&#8217;t the daughter of the meanest man in Greenstream
for nothing.... I suppose I&#8217;ll hear about
that money all the rest of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I will die, and then you will have no
bother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a nice way to talk; that makes me out
a fine figure of a man&nbsp;...&nbsp;with Mrs. Caley in the
kitchen there, laying right over every word; the old
vinegar bottle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you say another word about Mrs. Caley,&#8221;
Lattice declared passionately; &#8220;she nursed my
mother in her last sickness; and she took care of
me for years, when there wasn&#8217;t anybody else hardly
knew if I was alive or not. If it wasn&#8217;t for Mrs.
Caley right now I guess I&#8217;d be in an early grave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon stood silenced by the last outburst.
The tall, meager figure of Mrs. Caley appeared
upon the porch. She was clad in black
calico, and wore grey felt slippers. Her head was
lowered, her closed lips quivered, her bony fingers
twitched. She never addressed a word to Gordon
directly; and, he decided, when she did, it would be
monumental, dumbfounding. The present moment
was more than usually unpropitious; and,
discovering General Jackson at his heels, he picked the dog
up and departed for the stable, where he saw Sim
Caley putting the horse into the buggy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d go over to the farm beyond the
priest&#8217;s,&#8221; he answered Gordon&#8217;s query; &#8220;Tol&#8217;able&#8217;s
an awful slack hand with cattle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your wife ought to run that place; she&#8217;d walk
those steers around on a snake fence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Simeon Caley preserved a diplomatic silence.
He, too, was long and lean. He had eyes of the
most innocent and tender blue imaginable in a
countenance seamed and scarred by protracted debauch,
disease, abuse. It was said of him that if
all the liquor he had consumed were turned loose on
the mountain it would sweep Greenstream village to
the farther end of the valley.</p>
<p>His voice, like his eyes, was gentle. &#8220;Come right
along, Gord; there&#8217;s some draining you ought to
see to. It&#8217;s a nice drive, anyways.&#8221; Gordon took
the reins, slapping them on the rough, sturdy back
of the horse, and they started up the precarious track
to the road. General Jackson&#8217;s head hung panting,
wild-eyed, from the side of the vehicle.</p>

</div>

<p>It was late when they returned from the farm.
Gordon left the buggy at the Courthouse. The
thought of his dwelling, with Lattice&#8217;s importunate
fancies and complaints, was distasteful to him.
A long-drawn-out evening in the monotonous sitting
room, with the grim form of Mrs. Caley in the background,
was insupportable. There was no light in
the office of the <i>Bugle</i>, but there was a pale yellow
blur in the lower windows of Peterman&#8217;s hotel. It
might be that a drummer had arrived, and was entertaining
a local circle with the pungent wit of the
road; and Gordon made his way toward the hotel.</p>
<p>It was a painted, wooden structure, two stories in
height, with a wing that ran back from the road.
The rooms in the latter section were reached from
an outside, uncovered gallery, gained by a flight of
steps at the back. Contrary to his expectation no
one was in the office; a lamp shone on an empty
array of chairs. But some one was on the gallery
above; he could see a white skirt through the railing,
make out the dark blot of a head upon the night.
The illumination from within shone on his face.</p>
<p>The form above him leaned forward over the railing.
&#8220;Mr. Makimmon,&#8221; a woman&#8217;s voice said, &#8220;if
you want Mr. Peterman, I&#8217;ll call him. He&#8217;s at the
back of the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon was totally unaware of her identity.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied, hesitatingly, &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t after
him in particular&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know me,&#8221; she challenged, laughing;
&#8220;it&#8217;s Meta Beggs; I teach the school, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instantly the memory returned to him of a woman&#8217;s
round, gleaming shoulders slipping into a web
of soft white; he recalled the school-teacher&#8217;s bitter
arraignment of her life, her prospects. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
know you,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;and that&#8217;s the fact; it was
the dark.&#8221; He hesitated once more, conscious of the
awkwardness of his position, talking upward to an
indistinguishable shape. &#8220;I heard you were back,&#8221;
he continued impotently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she assented, &#8220;there was nothing else open....
Won&#8217;t you come up and smoke a cigarette?
It&#8217;s pleasant here on the gallery.&#8221;</p>
<p>He mounted the steps, making his way over the
narrow, hollow-sounding passage to her side. She
was seated overlooking the rift of the valley. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
get you a chair,&#8221; she said, rising. At her side a
door opened into a dim room. &#8220;No, no,&#8221; he protested,
&#8220;let me&mdash;in here?&#8221;</p>
<p>He entered the room. It was, he divined, hers.
His foot struck against a chair, and his hand caught
the back. A thin, clinging under-garment rested
on it, which he deposited on a vague bed. It stuck
to his fingers like a cobweb. There was just room
on the balcony to arrange the chairs side by side.</p>

<p>The spring night was potent, warm and
damp; it was filled with intangible influences
which troubled the mind and stirred
the memory to vain, melancholy groping. Meta
Beggs was so close to Gordon that their shoulders
touched. He rolled a cigarette and lit it, resting his
arms upon the railing. Her face was white in the
gloom; not white as Lettice&#8217;s had been, like a flower,
but sharply cut like marble; her nose was finely modelled,
her lips were delicately curved, but thin,
compressed. He could distinguish over her the
paramount air of dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>She aroused in him unbidden thoughts; without
the slightest freedom of gesture or words she gave
the impression of careless license. He grew instinctively,
at once, familiar, confidential, in his attitude
toward her. And she responded in the same
manner; she did not draw back when their arms
accidentally met.</p>
<p>An interest, a vivacity of manner, such as Gordon
had not experienced for weeks stirred in him. Meta
Beggs called back into being the old freedom of
stage-driving days, of the younger years. Her manner
flattered his sex vanity. They progressed
famously.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like the children any better than you
did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They get more like rats every year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought about you, held against your will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell lies; I went right out of your mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not as quick as I went out of yours. I did
think about you, though&mdash;&#8221; he stopped, but she insisted
upon his finishing the remark. &#8220;Well, I
remembered what you said about your shoulders,
and I saw you that night at your window....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Men, somehow, are always curious about me,&#8221;
she remarked indifferently; &#8220;they have bothered me
ever since I was a girl. I make them mad. I never
worry about such things myself&mdash;from the way
women talk, and men go on, there must be something
left out of me&nbsp;...&nbsp;it just seems silly to get all red
in the face&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He almost constructed her words into a challenge.
Five years ago, he continued, or only two, he would
have changed her conception of living, he would
have broken down her indifference, but now&mdash;His
mental deliberations ended abruptly, for, even in his
mind, he avoided all reference to Lettice; they studiously
omitted her name in their conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to the camp meeting on South
Fork next week?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;I have never
seen one. Buckley Simmons says all sorts of things
happen. He&#8217;s going to take me on Saturday. I
wish&mdash;&#8221; she broke off pointedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going to say that I wish, well&mdash;I wish I
were going with somebody else than Buckley; he
bothers me all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like a lot to take you. It&#8217;s not fit for you
to go, though. The best people in Greenstream
don&#8217;t. They get crazy with religion, and with rum;
often as not there&#8217;s shooting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I had no idea. I don&#8217;t know as I will go.
I wish you would be there. If I go will you be there
to look out for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of it. Still, if you&#8217;re there, and
want me around, I guess that&#8217;s where I will be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel better right away; I&#8217;ll see you then; it&#8217;s a
sort of engagement between you and me. Buckley
Simmons needn&#8217;t know. Perhaps we can slip away
from him for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>Voices rose from below them, and they drew back
instinctively. Gordon found in this desire to avoid
observation an additional bond with Meta Beggs;
the aspect of secrecy gave a flavor to their communion.
They remained silent, with their shoulders
pressed together, until the voices, the footfalls,
faded into the distance.</p>
<p>He rose to leave, and she held out her hand. At
its touch he recalled how pointed the fingers were;
it was incredibly cool and smooth, yet it seemed to
instil a subtle fire in his palm. She stood framed in
her doorway, bathed in the intimate, disturbing
aroma of her person. Gordon recalled the cobwebby
garment on the bed. He made an involuntary
step toward her, and she drew back into the
room&nbsp;...&nbsp;the night was breathlessly still. If he
took another step forward, he wondered, would she
still retreat? Somewhere in the dark interior he
would come close to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night.&#8221; Her level, impersonal voice was
like a breath of cold air upon his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night,&#8221; he returned hastily. &#8220;I got turned
right around.&#8221; His departure over the gallery was
not unlike a flight.</p>

</div>

<p>The memory of Meta Beggs was woven like a
bright thread through the monotonous texture
of the days which immediately followed.
She was never entirely out of his thoughts;
she stirred him out of all proportion to any assignable
cause; she irritated him. He remembered that
she said she made men &#8220;mad.&#8221; He recalled how
ridiculous he had felt as he had said, &#8220;Good night.&#8221;
He wished to repay her for that injury to his self-esteem.</p>
<p>At the same time, curiously, he was more patient
with Lettice, he had a more ready sympathy for her
intangible fancies. Perhaps for the first time he
enjoyed sitting quietly on the porch of his house
with her and General Jackson. He sat answering
her endless queries, fears, assenting half-absently
to her projections, with the thought of Meta Beggs
at the back of his mind. He wanted to be as nice
as possible to Lettice. Suddenly she seemed a little
removed from him, from the world in general, the
world of the emotions and ideas that centered about
the school-teacher.</p>
<p>Lettice was&mdash;superior; he recognized it pridefully.
Behind her temporary, rational vagaries
there was a quality of steadfastness. It was clear
to him now from its contrast to his own devious
mind. But he found a sharp pleasure in the mental
image of the Beggs woman. He recalled the burning
sensation that had lingered in his palm from the
touch of her hand, the pressure of her shoulder
against his as they had drawn back from the vision
of those below.</p>
<p>He went early to the camp meeting on the Saturday
appointed.</p>
<hr class='major' />

</div>

<p>He drove over the road that lay at the base
of the western range away from his dwelling
and Greenstream village. The mature
spring day had almost the appearance of summer;
the valley was flooded with sparkling sunlight;
but the young leaves were still red, the greenery still
translucent, the trees black with risen sap. The
buggy rolled through the shallow, rocky fords, the
horse&#8217;s hoofs flinging up the water in shining drops.
The road rose slightly, turning to the right, where an
intermediate valley lay diagonally through the range.
Save for small, scattered farms the bottomland was
uncultivated, the tangled brush impenetrable.</p>
<p>Gordon passed other vehicles, bound toward the
camp meeting, usually a single seat crowded with
three, or even four, adult forms. He passed flat
wagons with their bottoms filled with straw, on
which women sat with stiffly-extended legs. The
young women wore gay colors, their eyes sparkled
in hardy faces, their hands, broad and red and capable,
awkwardly disposed. The older women,
with shawls folded about their stooped shoulders,
were close-lipped, somber. The men were sparely
built, with high, prominent cheek bones, long, hollow
cheeks and shaven mouths touched with sardonic
humor, under undented, black felt hats. There were
an appreciable number of invalids and leaden-faced
idiots.</p>
<p>The way grew wilder, the natural forms shrunk,
the valley became a small plain of broken, rocky
hillocks matted with thorny bushes, surrounded by
marshes of rank grass, flags, half-grown osiers.
The vehicles, drawn into a single way, crowded together,
progressed slowly. Gordon saw in the back
of the buggy before him two whiskey jugs. Some
one far ahead began to sing a revival hymn, and it
ran along the line of carriages like a trail of ignited
powder. A deep bass caught it behind Gordon
Makimmon, then the piercing soprano of a woman
farther back.</p>
<p>The camp meeting spread over a small, irregular
plateau surrounded by swamp and sluggish streams.
Gordon turned off the road, and drove over a rough,
short descent to a ledge of solid ground by a stream
and fringe of willows. The spring torrents had
subsided, leaving the grass, the willows, covered
with a grey, crackling coat of mud; the air had a
damp, fetid smell; beyond, the swamp bubbled gaseously.
The close line of hitched teams disappeared
about an elbow of the thicket; groups of men
gathered in the noisome shadows, bottles were
passed, heads thrown back and arms bent aloft.</p>
<p>Above, a great, sagging tent was staked to the
obdurate ground. To the left a wooden floor had
been temporarily laid about a four-square, open
counter, now bare, with a locked shed for storage.
Before Gordon was the sleeping tent for women.
The sun seemed unable to dispel the miasma of the
swamp, the surrounding aspect of mean desolation.
The scene was petty, depressing. It was surcharged
by a curious air of tension, of suspense, a brooding,
treacherous hysteria, an ugly, raw, emotional menace.
A service was in progress; a sustained, convulsive
murmur came from within, a wordless, fluctuating
lament. Suddenly it was pierced by a shrill,
high scream, a voice tormented out of all semblance
to reason. The sound grew deeper and louder;
it swung into a rhythm which formed into words,
lines, a primitive chant that filled the plateau,
swelled out over the swamp. It continued for an
incredible length of time, rising to an unbearable
pitch, then it died away in a great gasp.</p>
<p>A thin, sinister echo rose from among the willows&mdash;emotional,
shrill curses, a brief, raving outburst
of passion, sharply punctuated with double
shots, and falling abruptly to heavy silence. Gordon
saw men obscurely running below.</p>
<p>The curtained entrance to the tent was pushed
aside, and a woman walked stiffly out, her hands
clenched, and her glassy eyes set in a fixed stare.
Her hat was gone, and her grey hair lay upon one
shoulder. She progressed, stumbling blindly over
the inequalities of the ground, until she tripped on a
stone. She lay where she had fallen, with her muscles
jerking and shuddering, until a man appeared
from behind the counter, and dragged her unceremoniously
to the women&#8217;s shelter.</p>
<p>Gordon entered the tent where the service was in
progress. A subdued light filtered through the canvas
upon a horde that filled every foot of space;
they sat pressed together on long, rough boards
nailed together in the semblance of benches. On a
platform at the farther side a row of men and women
sat against the canvas wall; to their left a folding
organ had been erected, and was presided over by
a man with a blurred, greyish countenance; while,
standing at the forefront of the platform, a large,
heavy man in a black frock coat was addressing the
assemblage. He had a round, pallid, smooth face
with long, black hair brushed back upon his coat
collar, and great, soft, white hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;... it&#8217;s rising,&#8221; he proclaimed, in a loud, sing-song
voice, &#8220;the flood is rising; now it&#8217;s about your
pockets&mdash;praise God! now it&#8217;s above your waists.
It&#8217;s rising! it&#8217;s rising! Hallelujah! the sea of redemption
is rising,&#8221; his voice rose with the figurative
flood. &#8220;At last it&#8217;s about your hearts, your hearts
are immersed in the Sacred Tide.&#8221;</p>
<p>A man beside Gordon groaned and dropped upon
his knees. A woman cried, &#8220;God! God! God!&#8221;
A spindling, overgrown boy rose fumbling at his
throat. &#8220;I can&#8217;t breathe,&#8221; he choked, &#8220;I can&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221;
His face grew purplish, congested. The tumult
swelled, directed, dominated, by the voice of the
revivalist. He dropped upon his knees, and, amid
the sobbing silence, pled with an invisible Judge
hovering, apparently, over a decision to destroy at
one bloody blow the recalcitrant peoples of the
earth, the peoples of His making.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spare us,&#8221; he implored; &#8220;spare us, the sheep
of hell; lead us to Thy shining pasture&nbsp;...&nbsp;still
water; lead us from the great fire of the eternal pit,
from the boiling bodies of the unsaved....&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon indifferently regarded the
clamor. The process of &#8220;getting religion&#8221; was familiar,
commonplace. He saw Tol&#8217;able sitting on
a back bench; with a mutual gesture the two men
rose and left the tent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to bring m&#8217;wife,&#8221; Tol&#8217;able explained;
&#8220;did you see her sitting on the platform? She&#8217;s
one of the main grievers. I got some good licker
in the wagon&mdash;better have a comforter.&#8221;</p>
<p>They walked down to a dusty, two-seated surrey,
where, from under a horse blanket, Tol&#8217;able
produced a small jug. He wiped the mouth on his
sleeve and passed it to Gordon; then held the gurgling
vessel to his open throat. &#8220;There was some
hell raised last night,&#8221; he proceeded; &#8220;a man from
up back had his head busted with a stone, and a
drunken looney shot through the women&#8217;s tent: an
old girl hollered out they had Goddy right in there
among &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were shooting a while back,&#8221; Gordon observed
indifferently. &#8220;Have you seen Buck Simmons
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I hain&#8217;t. He wouldn&#8217;t be here noways.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon preserved a discreet silence in regard to
his source of assurance of Buckley&#8217;s presence at the
camp meeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have another drink, Gord.&#8221;</p>
<p>The services were temporarily suspended, and the
throng emptied from the tent. A renewed sanity
clothed them&mdash;girls drew into squares of giggling
defense against the verbal sallies of robustly-witted
young men. Women collected their offspring, gathering
in circles about opened boxes of lunch: a multitude
of papers and box lids littered the ground.
A hot, steaming odor, analogous to coffee, rose from
the crowded counter. A prodigious amount of raw
whiskey was consumed among the vehicles by the
stream and mud-coated willows.</p>
<p>Gordon slowly made his way through the throng,
in search of Meta Beggs; perhaps, after all, she had
decided not to come; he might easily miss her in
that mob. It was not clear in his mind what he
would do if he saw her. She would be with Buckley
Simmons, and there was a well recognized course of
propriety for such occasions: he would be expected
merely to greet in passing a girl accompanying
another man. Any other proceeding would be met
with instant resentment. And Buckley Simmons,
Gordon knew, must still nurse a secret antagonism
toward him. However, he had disposed of Buckley
in the past&nbsp;...&nbsp;if necessary he could do so again.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the service tent the organist,
his countenance still livid in the sunlight, blew a
throaty summons on a cornet, and the crowd slowly
trailed back within. In the thinning groups Gordon
saw the school-teacher, clad in a bright blue
skirt and a hat with a stiff, blue feather. She was
at Buckley&#8217;s side, consuming a slice of cake with
delicate, precise motions of her hand, and greeting
with patent abstraction his solicitous attentions.</p>

</div>

<p>Meta Beggs saw Gordon at the same
moment; and, without observation on the
part of her escort, beckoned him to her.
She said promptly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Makimmon, please take care of me while
Buckley goes down by those carriages, where we
saw you a little while ago, and gets his share of the
refreshment there. I&#8217;m certain that dusty road
made him as dry as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buckley grinned; such frank feminine acknowledgment
and solicitude for the masculine palate was
rare in Greenstream. &#8220;Why, no, Miss Beggs,&#8221; he
rejoined; &#8220;I&#8217;m in good shape for a while yet. I
got a flask under the seat of the buggy&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I insist on your tending to it at once. I know
just how it is with men&mdash;they have got to have that
little refreshment&nbsp;...&nbsp;don&#8217;t you call it &#8217;life preserver&#8217;?
I&#8217;ll be right by the counter; if Mr. Makimmon
will be so kind&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Buckley agreed, &#8220;a drink don&#8217;t go bad
any time; the road was kind of dusty. If you insist,
Miss Beggs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do! I do!&#8221; He turned and left them, striding
toward the lower level. Then:</p>
<p>&#8220;The fool!&#8221; she exclaimed viciously; &#8220;my arm
is all black and blue where he pinched it. My skin
is not like the hides on these mountain girls, it tears
and bruises dreadfully easy, it&#8217;s so fine. Let&#8217;s go
back there,&#8221; she pointed to where, behind the platform
and counter, a path was trampled through
brush higher than their heads. Gordon glanced
swiftly in the direction in which Buckley Simmons
had vanished. &#8220;He won&#8217;t be back,&#8221; she added contemptuously,
&#8220;for a half hour. He&#8217;ll stay down
there and drink rotten whiskey and sputter over rotten
stories.&#8221; Without further parley she proceeded
in the direction indicated; and, following her, Gordon
dismissed Buckley from his thoughts.</p>
<p>Meta Beggs wore a shirtwaist perforated like a
sieve; through it he saw flimsy lace, a faded blue
ribband, her gleaming shoulders. In an obscure
turn of the path she stopped and faced him. &#8220;Just
look,&#8221; she proclaimed, unfastening a bone button
that held her cuff. She rolled her sleeve back over
her arm. High up, near the soft under-turning,
were visible the bluish prints of fingers. &#8220;You
see,&#8221; she added; &#8220;and there are others&nbsp;...&nbsp;where
I can&#8217;t show you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Buck&#8217;s pretty vigorous with the girls,&#8221; he admitted;
&#8220;I once dropped him down a spell for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was fascinated by her naked, shapely arm; it was
slender at the wrist, and surprisingly round above, at
a soft, brown shadow. He was seized by a desire
to touch it, and he held her pointed elbow while he
examined the bruises more minutely. &#8220;That&#8217;s bad,&#8221;
he pronounced; &#8220;on that pretty skin, too.&#8221; He was
confused by the close proximity of her bare flesh, the
pulse in his neck beat visibly.</p>
<p>For a moment she stood motionless; then, with her
eyes half closed, sulky, she drew away from him and
rearranged her sleeve.</p>
<p>The brush ended on a slope where pine trees had
covered the ground with a glossy mat of bronzed
needles; and his companion sank to a sitting position
with her back against a trunk. They were outside
the influence of the camp meeting, beyond its
unnatural excitation. The pine trees were black
against the brilliant day; they might have been cast
in iron, there was no suggestion of growth in the
dun covering below; it was as seasonless where they
sat as the sea; the air, faintly spiced and still, seemed
to have lain unchanged through countless ages.</p>
<p>Meta Beggs sat motionless, with a look of inexpressible
boredom on her pale countenance. Her
hands, Gordon thought, were like folded buds of the
mountain magnolia.</p>
<p>She said, unexpectedly, &#8220;You&#8217;re rich now, aren&#8217;t
you, one of the richest men in the county?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why I&mdash;I got some money; that is, my wife
has.&#8221;</p>
<p>She dismissed, with an impatient gesture, the distinction.
&#8220;Money is life,&#8221; she continued, with a
perceptible, envious longing, &#8220;it&#8217;s freedom, all the
things worth having. It makes women&mdash;it&#8217;s their
leather boxes full of rings and pins and necklaces,
their dresses of all-over lace, their silk and hand
scalloped and embroidered underclothes; it&#8217;s their
fascination and chance and power&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to see you in some of those lace
things,&#8221; he returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, get them for me,&#8221; she answered hardily.</p>
<p>Utterly unprepared for this direct attack he was
thoroughly disconcerted. &#8220;Why, certainly!&#8221; he replied,
laboriously polite, &#8220;the next time&mdash;I&#8217;ll do it!&mdash;when
I&#8217;m in Stenton again I&#8217;ll bring you a pair
of silk stockings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Black,&#8221; she said practically, &#8220;and size eight
and a half. You will like me in black silk stockings,&#8221;
she added enigmatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet,&#8221; he replied with enthusiasm. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
wait to go, but send for them. You would make
the dollars dance. You are different from&mdash;&#8221; he
was going to say Lettice, but, instinctively, he
changed it to, &#8220;the women around here. You&#8217;ve
got an awful lot of ginger to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what I want, and I&#8217;m not afraid to pay
for it. Almost everybody wants the same thing&mdash;plenty
and pleasure, but they&#8217;re afraid of the price;
they are afraid of it alive and when they will be
dead. Women set such a store on what they call
their virtue, and men tend so much to the opinion
of others, that they don&#8217;t get anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you set anything on your&mdash;your virtue?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d make it serve me; I wouldn&#8217;t be a silly slave
to it all my life. If I can get things with it that&#8217;s
what I&#8217;m going to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon found these potent words
from such a pleasing woman as Meta Beggs. Any
philosophy underlying them, any ruthless strength,
escaped him entirely. They appealed solely to him
as &#8220;gay,&#8221; highly suggestive. They stirred his blood
into warm, heady tides of feeling. He moved over
the smooth covering of pine needles, closer to her.
But with an expression of petulance she rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose we must look for Buckley,&#8221; she observed.
Gordon had completely forgotten Buckley
Simmons&#8217; presence at the camp meeting. The
school-teacher, swaying slimly, led the way over the
path to the plateau.</p>
<p>They saw Buckley Simmons at once: he was
talking in an excited, angry manner to a small group
of men. A gesture was made toward Gordon and
his companion; Buckley turned, and his face flushed
darkly, Gordon, stood still, Meta Beggs fell
behind, as the former made his way toward them.
Buckley spoke loudly when he was still an appreciable
distance away:</p>
<p>&#8220;You were mighty considerate about my dusty
throat,&#8221; he began with heavy sarcasm; &#8220;I ought to
have seen at the time that you had it made up between
you. This is the second time that you have
broken in on me, Makimmon. I&#8217;m not a boy any
longer. You can&#8217;t tread on me. It&#8217;s going to stop&nbsp;...&nbsp;now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing for you to get excited about,
Buck. Miss Beggs and I took a little stroll while
you were away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A &#8216;little stroll.&#8217;&#8221; Buckley produced a heavy
gold watch, the highly chased cover of which he
snapped back. &#8220;Over half an hour,&#8221; he proclaimed;
&#8220;you stayed too long this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon was aware of a form at his back. He
turned, and saw Tol&#8217;able.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble, Gord?&#8221; the latter asked.
Two or three others were compactly grouped behind
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Buckley&#8217;s hot because I walked with Miss
Beggs while he took a drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men about Buckley Simmons closed up.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t let Gordon crowd you down,&#8221; they advised
their principal; &#8220;put it up against him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you got enough at home,&#8221; Buckley demanded,
&#8220;without playing around here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Anger swiftly rose to Gordon Makimmon&#8217;s head.
His hand fell and remained close by his side.
&#8220;Keep your tongue off my home,&#8221; he commanded
harshly, &#8220;or you will get more than a horsewhipping.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By God,&#8221; Buckley articulated. His face
changed from dark to pale, his mouth opened, his
eyes were staring. He fumbled desperately in his
pocket. Gordon&#8217;s hand closed smoothly, instantly,
about the handle of his revolver. But, before he
could level it, an arm shot out from behind him,
and a stone the size of two fists sped like a bullet,
striking Buckley Simmons where his hair and forehead
joined. Gordon, in a species of shocked curiosity
and surprise, clearly saw the stone hit the
other. There was a sound like that made by a heel
breaking a scum of ice on a frozen road.</p>
<p>Buckley said, &#8220;Ah,&#8221; half turned, and dropped like
a piece of carpet.</p>
<p>The belligerent attitude instantly evaporated
from the group behind the stricken man. &#8220;Gracious,&#8221;
some one muttered foolishly. They all
joined in a stooping circle about the prostrate figure.
It was seen immediately that the skull was broken&mdash;a
white splinter of bone stood up from a matted
surface of blood and hair and dirt. Buckley&#8217;s eyelids
winked continuously and with great rapidity.</p>
<p>A mingled concern and deep relief swept through
Gordon Makimmon. He knew that, had the stone
not been thrown, he would have killed Buckley Simmons.
He wondered if Tol&#8217;able had done him that
act of loyalty. It had, probably, fatally wounded
its object. He turned with a swift, silent look of
inquiry to Tol&#8217;able. The other, unmoved, dexterously
shifted a mouthful of tobacco. &#8220;Whoever
did that,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;could sure throw a rock.&#8221;</p>
<p>A crowd gathered swiftly, cautious and murmuring.
Simmons was lifted on a horse blanket to the
flooring by the counter. There was an outcry for a
doctor, but none was present, and it was agreed that
the wounded man must be hurried into Greenstream.
&#8220;He won&#8217;t get there alive,&#8221; it was freely predicted;
&#8220;the top of his head is crumbled right off.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>Gordon found Meta Beggs on the outskirt
of the throng; she was pale but otherwise
unshaken. &#8220;I was sure you were going to
shoot Buckley,&#8221; she told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;So was I,&#8221; he returned grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will he die?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks bad&mdash;his head&#8217;s cracked. You didn&#8217;t
see anybody throw that stone!&#8221; His voice had
more the accent of a command than an inquiry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really didn&#8217;t; the men were standing so closely&nbsp;...&nbsp;nobody saw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. You&#8217;ll drive home with me, for
certain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you didn&#8217;t kill him,&#8221; she confided to
Gordon in the buggy. She was sitting very close to
him. &#8220;It would have&mdash;upset things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you were a scrap frightened,&#8221; he
asserted admiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t. I thought how foolish you would be
to spoil everything for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would have gone into the mountains,&#8221; he explained;
&#8220;a hundred men would have kept the law
off me. I was a year and a half there, when&mdash;when
I was younger,&#8221; he ended lamely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like that,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;I understand it. I&#8217;ve
wanted to murder; but it would have been silly, I
would have had to pay too dearly for a passing
rage.&#8221; There was a menace in her even voice, a
cold echo like that from a closed, empty room, that
oppressed Gordon unpleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re not as dangerous as that,&#8221; he responded,
more lightly. He wondered, unable to decide,
if she were consciously pressing her body
against him, or if it were merely the jolting of the
buggy? They were passing through the valley that
led into Greenstream; the sun was lowering behind
them, the shadows creeping out. They dropped
from the rough, minor forms into the bigger sweep&mdash;it
was like a great, green bed half filled with a
gold flood. Gordon&#8217;s horse walked, and, in their
slow progress, the stream of light flowing between the
ranges changed to a stream of shadow. A miraculous
pink rose opened in the east and scattered its
glowing petals across the sky. The buggy wound,
like an infinitesimal toy, over the darkening road.</p>
<p>He passed his dwelling, a long, irregular roof
against the veiled surface of the stream; a light
shone from the kitchen window. The streets of the
village, folded in warm dusk, were empty; the white
columns of the Courthouse glimmered behind the
shafts of the trees on the lawn. Supper was in progress
at Peterman&#8217;s hotel; as Gordon and Meta Beggs
left the buggy they heard the rattle of dishes within.
She walked a few steps, then stopped, was about
to speak, but she saw that Gordon had followed her,
and turned and led the way to the steps giving to the
gallery above.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon followed her without reason,
without plan, almost subconsciously. He walked
close behind her to where she opened the door to
her room: it was grey within, a dim curtain swelled
faintly with an unfelt air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black,&#8221; he repeated stupidly, &#8220;size eight and a
half.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stepped into the room, and faced him; her
lips were parted over a glimmer of teeth. He took
her roughly in his arms, and she turned up her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the stockings,&#8221; she said, as he kissed her.</p>
<p>He kissed her again, and she murmured, faintly,
&#8220;Two pairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>It enraged him that she was so collected; her body,
pressed against him from knee to shoulder, was without
a tremor, her breast was tranquil. She might
have been, from her unstudied, total detachment, a
fine, flexible statue in his straining embrace, under
his eager lips. Suddenly, with no apparent effort,
she released herself.</p>
<p>She removed the hat with the blue feather, calmly
laid it on the indistinct bed, and moved to the mirror
of a small bureau, where her hands glided over her
smooth hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men are so&mdash;elementary,&#8221; she observed, &#8220;and all
alike. I wish I could feel what you do,&#8221; she turned
to Gordon, &#8220;just once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you made of?&#8221; he demanded tensely;
&#8220;stone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I often wonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>She crossed the room to the gallery, where she
glanced swiftly about. &#8220;You must leave, and I&#8217;ll
go down to supper. Next Sunday I am going to
walk&nbsp;...&nbsp;in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you go out by the priest&#8217;s,&#8221; he suggested, &#8220;and
turn to the right, you will find a pretty stream;
further down there&#8217;s an old mill.&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew back, waiting for him to descend to the
ground below.</p>
<p>Simmons&#8217; clerk was standing on the platform before
the store, and Gordon drew up. &#8220;How&#8217;s Buckley?&#8221;
he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad,&#8221; the other answered laconically. &#8220;They
sent to Stenton for help. His head&#8217;s cracked. It&#8217;s
funny,&#8221; he commented, &#8220;with a hundred people
around nobody saw that stone thrown &#8217;tall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t do sometimes to see this and that,&#8221; Gordon
explained, tightening the reins.</p>
<p>He unhitched the horse in his shedlike stable
by the aid of a hand lantern. He was reluctant to
go into the house, and he prolonged the unbuckling
of the familiar straps, the measuring of feed, beyond
all necessity. Outside, he thought he heard General
Jackson by the stream, and he stood whistling
softly, but only the first notes of the whippoorwills
responded. &#8220;The night&#8217;s just come down all at
once,&#8221; he said. Finally, with a rigid assumption
of indifference covering an uneasy heart, he went in.</p>
<p>Lettice was asleep by the lamp in the sitting room.
She looked younger than ever, but there were shadows
under her eyes, her mouth was a little drawn as
if by the memory of pain. A shawl, he saw, had
slipped from her shoulders, and he walked clumsily
on the tips of his shoes and rearranged it. Then he
sat down and waited for her to wake.</p>
<p>The flame of the lamp was like a section of an
orange; it cast a warm, low radiance through the
room. His gaze rested on the photograph of Lettice&#8217;s
mother in her coffin. He imagined that paper
effigy of inanimate clay moved, turned its dull head
to regard him. &#8220;I&#8217;m getting old,&#8221; he told himself
contemptuously, repressing an involuntary start of
surprise. His heart rested like a lump of lead in
his breast; it oppressed him so that his breathing
grew labored. His mind returned to Meta Beggs:
coldness like hers was not natural, it was not right.
He thought again, as men have vainly of such
women since the dawning of consciousness, that it
would be stirring to fire her indifference, to ignite a
passion in response to his own desire. The memory
of her slender, full body, her cool lips, tormented
him.</p>
<p>Lettice woke abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gordon!&#8221; she cried, in an odd, muffled voice;
&#8220;you&#8217;re always late; your supper is always spoiled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had my supper,&#8221; he hurriedly fabricated, &#8220;at
Peterman&#8217;s. It&#8217;s nice in here, Lettice, with you and
all the things around. It has a comfortable look.
You&#8217;re right pretty, Lettice, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unexpected compliment brought a flush to her
cheeks. &#8220;I&#8217;m not pretty now,&#8221; she replied; &#8220;I&#8217;m
all pulled out.&#8221; General Jackson ambled into the
room, sat between them. &#8220;Let&#8217;s hear the General
sing,&#8221; she proposed.</p>
<p>Gordon wound the phonograph, and the distant,
metallic voice repeated the undeniable fact that Rip
Van Winkle had been unaware of the select pleasures
of Coney Island. The dog whimpered, then
raised his head in a despairing bay.</p>
<p>A time might come in a man&#8217;s life, Gordon Makimmon
realized, when this peaceful interior would
spell complete happiness.</p>

</div>

<p>On Sunday he strolled soon after breakfast
in the direction of the priest&#8217;s. Merlier
was standing at the door to his house.
Gordon noted that the other was growing heavier,
folds dropped from the corners of his shaven lips,
his eyes had retreated in fatty pouches. His gaze
was still searchingly keen, but the priest was wearing
out. Gordon stopped in response to his silent
nod.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to let up on yourself a little,&#8221; he advised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; the other briefly queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why?&#8217;, so&#8217;s you will last longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this the priest made no reply. A short, awkward
silence followed during which Gordon grew
restive. &#8220;If I looked so glum about Greenstream,&#8221;
he continued, &#8220;I&#8217;d move out.&#8221; It was as though he
had not spoken. &#8220;I&#8217;d go back where I came from,&#8221;
he persisted sharply. The priest&#8217;s lips moved,
formed words:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Che discese da Fiesole ab antico.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>His imperturbable manner offered Gordon not the
slightest opening; and he continued uncomfortably
on his way. There was a quality about that thick,
black-clad figure which cast a shadow over the
cloudless day, it blunted the anticipated pleasure of
his meeting with Meta Beggs. There was about
Merlier a smell of death like the smell of sooty
smoke.</p>
<p>The stream lay shining along its wooded course;
the range greenly aflame with new foliage rose into
radiant space; flickers hammered on resonant, dead
wood. Gordon banished the somber memory of the
priest. He was conscious of a sudden excitement,
a keenness of response to living like a renewal of
youth. He wished that Meta Beggs would appear;
his direction to her had been vague; she might easily
go astray and miss him. But he saw her, after
what seemed an interminable period, leaving the
road and crossing the strip of sod that bordered the
stream. She had on a white dress that clung to her
figure, and a broad, flapping straw hat wound with
white. She saw him and waved. The brush rose
thickly along the water, but there was a footway at
its edge, with occasional, broader reaches of rough
sod. In one of the latter she stooped, made a swift
movement with the hem of her skirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; she smiled; &#8220;I said you would like me in
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>He attempted to catch her in his arms, but she
eluded him. &#8220;Please,&#8221; she protested coolly, &#8220;don&#8217;t
be tiresome.... We must talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>He followed her by the devious edge of the stream
to the ruined mill. He could see the blurring impress
of the black silk stockings through the web of
her dress; the dress had shrunk from repeated washing,
and drew tightly across her shoulders. She
walked lightly and well, and sat with a graceful
sweep on a fallen, moldering beam. Beyond them
the broad expanse of the mill pond was paved with
still shadows; a dust of minute insects swept above
the clouded surface. The water ran slowly over the
dam, everywhere cushioned with deep moss, and fell
with an eternal splatter on the rocks below.</p>
<p>Gordon rolled a cigarette from the muslin bag of
Green Goose. &#8220;Why do you still smoke that
grass?&#8221; she demanded curiously. &#8220;You could get
the best cigars from Cuba.&#8221; He explained, and she
regarded him impatiently. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you realize what
possibilities you have!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I might, with assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you once saw the world! I&#8217;ve been reading
about Paris, the avenues and cafés and theaters.
Why, in the cafés there they drink only champagne
and dance all night. The women come with their
lovers in little closed carriages, and go back to little
closed rooms hung in brocade. They never wear
anything but evening clothes, for they are never out
but at night&mdash;satin gowns with trains and bare
shoulders.&#8221;</p>
<p>He endeavored to picture himself in such a city,
amid such a life, with Meta Beggs. He felt that she
would be entirely in place in the little carriages,
drinking champagne. &#8220;That&#8217;s where they eat
frogs,&#8221; he remarked inanely. In the tensity of her
feeling, the bitterness of her longing, her envy, she
cursed him for a dull fool. Then, recovering her
composure with a struggle:</p>
<p>&#8220;I would make a man drunk with pleasure in a
place like that. He would be proud of me, and all
the other men would hate him; they would all want
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some would come pretty near getting you, too,&#8221;
he replied with a flash of penetration; &#8220;those with
the fastest horses or longest pockets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would be true to whoever took me there,&#8221; she
declared; &#8220;out of gratitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew a deep breath. &#8220;What would you say,&#8221;
he inquired, leaning toward her, &#8220;to a trip to&mdash;to
Richmond? We could be gone the best part of a
week.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed scornfully. &#8220;Do you think I am as
cheap as that&mdash;to be bought over Sunday?&#8221; She
rose, and stood before him, sharply outlined against
the foliage, the water, the momentary, flittering insects,
taunting, provocative, sensual.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five years ago,&#8221; he told her, &#8220;if you had tried
this foolery, I would have choked you, and thrown
what was left in the dam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now&mdash;&#8221; she jeered fearlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s different,&#8221; he admitted moodily.</p>
<p>It was. Somewhere the lash had been lost from
the whip of his desire. He was still eager, tormented
by the wish to feel her disdainful mouth
against his. The recrudescence of spring burned
in his veins; but, at the same time, there was a new
reluctance upon his flesh. The inanimate, obese
mask of the priest, Lettice&#8217;s sleeping countenance
faintly stamped with pain, hovered in his consciousness.
&#8220;It&#8217;s different,&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are losing your hold on pleasure,&#8221; she observed
critically aloof.</p>
<p>He leaned forward, and grasped her wrist, and,
with a slight motion, forced her upon her knees.
&#8220;If you are pleasure I&#8217;m not,&#8221; he challenged.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are hurting my arm,&#8221; she said coldly. His
grip tightened, and a small grimace crossed her lips.
&#8220;Let go,&#8221; she demanded; and then a swift passion
shrilled her voice. &#8220;Let go, you are crushing my
wrist. Damn you to hell! if you spoil my wrist
I&#8217;ll kill you.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment, as he held her, she reminded Gordon
of a venomous snake; he had never seen such
a lithe, wicked hatred in any other human being.
&#8220;You are a gentle object,&#8221; he satirized her, loosening
his hold.</p>
<p>She rose slowly and stood fingering her wrist.
The emotion died from her countenance. &#8220;You
see,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;my body is all I have to take
me out of this,&#8221; she motioned to the slumbering water,
the towering range, &#8220;and I can&#8217;t afford to have it
spoiled. You wouldn&#8217;t like me if I were lame or
crooked. Men don&#8217;t. The religious squashes can
say all they like about the soul, but a woman&#8217;s body
is the only really important thing to her. No one
bothers about your soul, but they judge your figure
across the street.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yours hasn&#8217;t done you much good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will,&#8221; she returned somberly, &#8220;it must&mdash;real
lace and wine and ease.&#8221; She came very close to
him; he could feel the faint jarring of her heart, the
moisture of her breath. &#8220;And you could get them
for me. I would make you mad with sensation.&#8221;</p>
<p>He kissed her again and again, crushing her to
him. She abandoned herself to his arms, but she
was as untouched, as impersonal, as a stuffed woman
of cool satin. In the end he voluntarily released
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t take fire from a pine knot,&#8221; he
said unsteadily.</p>
<p>Her deft hands rearranged her hat. &#8220;Some day
a man will murder me,&#8221; she replied in level tones;
&#8220;perhaps I&#8217;ll get a thrill from that.&#8221; Her voice
grew as cutting as a surgeon&#8217;s polished knife.
&#8220;Please don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m the kind of woman men
take out in the woods and kiss. You may have discovered
that I don&#8217;t like kissing. I&#8217;m going to be
honester still&mdash;last year, when you were mending
the minister&#8217;s ice house, and hadn&#8217;t a dollar, I wasn&#8217;t
the smallest bit interested in you; and this year I
am.&mdash;Not on account of the money itself,&#8221; she was
careful to add, &#8220;but because of you and the money
together. Don&#8217;t you see&mdash;it changed you; it&#8217;s perfectly
right that it should, and that I should recognize
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds fair enough,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;Now
the question is, what are we going to do together,
you and me and the money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you do what I wanted?&#8221; she asked at his
shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We might try Richmond.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fool yourself,&#8221; she returned hardily; &#8220;I
know all about those trial trips. Any man I go with
has got to go far: I don&#8217;t intend to be left at some
pokey little way station with everything gone and
nothing accomplished.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; he objected, &#8220;a man who went with you
could never come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Back to this wilderness,&#8221; she scoffed; &#8220;any one
should thank God for being taken out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always lived here, my father too, and his
before him; and back of that we came from mountains.
We&#8217;re mountain blood; I don&#8217;t know if we
could get used to anything else, live down yonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d civilize you,&#8221; she promised him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps&mdash;&#8221; he assented slowly.</p>
<p>Suddenly from beyond the ruin came the stir
of a horse moving in harness, the sound stopped
and the voices of men grew audible. Instinctively
Gordon and Meta Beggs drew behind a standing
fragment of wall. Gordon could see, through the
displaced, rotting boards, a buggy and two men
standing at the side of the road. One, he recognized,
was Valentine Simmons; he easily made out
the small, alert figure. The other, with his back to
the mill, held outspread a sheet of paper. There
was something familiar about the carriage of the
head, a glimpse of beard, a cigar from which were
expelled copious volumes of smoke. Gordon vainly
racked his memory for a clue to the latter, elusive
personality. He heard Simmons say:</p>
<p>&#8220;... by the South Fork entrance&nbsp;...&nbsp;through
the valley.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger partially turned, and Gordon instantly
recalled where he had seen him before&mdash;it
was the man he had driven from Stenton with the
surprising foreknowledge of the County, who had
been met by Pompey Hollidew. He replied to Simmons,
&#8220;Exactly&nbsp;...&nbsp;timber sidings at the principal
depots.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were, evidently, discussing a projected road.
Gordon subconsciously exclaimed, half aloud,
&#8220;Railroad!&#8221; A swift illumination bathed in complete
comprehension the whole affair&mdash;the connection,
of Simmons, old Pompey&#8217;s options and the
stranger. This railroad, the coming of which
would increase enormously the timber values of
Greenstream County, had been the covert reason
for Simmons&#8217; desire to purchase the options held by
the Hollidew estate; it had been, during Pompey
Hollidew&#8217;s life, the reason for the acquisition of
such extended timber interests. Hollidew, Simmons
and Company had joined in a conspiracy to purchase
them throughout the county at a nominal sum and
reap the benefits of the large enhancement. The
death of the former had interrupted that satisfactory
scheme; now Valentine Simmons had conceived the
plan of gathering all the profit to himself. And,
Gordon admitted, he had nearly succeeded&nbsp;...&nbsp;nearly.
A slow smile crossed Gordon Makimmon&#8217;s
features as he realized what a pleasant conversation
he would have with Simmons at the latter&#8217;s expense.
He had never conceived the possibility of getting
the astute storekeeper into such a satisfactory,
retaliatory position. He would extract the last penny of
profit and enjoyment from the other&#8217;s surprise.</p>
<p>The men beyond re-entered the buggy and drove
toward the village.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Meta Beggs asked; &#8220;you look
pleased.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I fell on a little scheme,&#8221; he replied evasively;
&#8220;a trifle&nbsp;...&nbsp;worth a hundred thousand or
more to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes widened with avidity. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know
the whole, God forsaken place was worth a thousand,&#8221;
she remarked. &#8220;A hundred thousand,&#8221; the
mere repetition of that sum brought a new shine into
her gaze, instinctively drew her closer to Gordon&#8217;s
side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just that alone would be enough&mdash;&#8221; she said,
and paused.</p>
<p>He ignored this opening in the anticipated pleasure
of his coming interview with Valentine Simmons.</p>
<p>A palpable annoyance took possession of her at
Gordon&#8217;s absorption. &#8220;It must be near dinner at
Peterman&#8217;s,&#8221; she remarked; &#8220;on Sunday you&#8217;ve got
to be on time.&#8221;</p>
<p>In response to her suggestion he turned toward
the road. They walked back silently until they
were opposite the priest&#8217;s. &#8220;I&#8217;d better go on alone,&#8221;
she decided. Her hands clung to his shoulders and
she sought his lips. &#8220;Soon again,&#8221; she murmured.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t desert me; I am entirely alone except for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She left him and swiftly crossed the green to the
road.</p>

</div>

<p>Gordon carefully explained the entire circumstance
of the timber to Lettice. &#8220;I just
happened to be by the stream,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;and overheard them. Your father and Simmons
evidently had arranged the thing, and Simmons
was going to crowd you out of all the gain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see to it,&#8221; she returned listlessly; &#8220;you have
my name on that paper, the power of something or
other.&#8221; She was seated on the porch of their dwelling.
A low-drifting mass of formless grey cloud
filled the narrow opening of the ranges, drooping
in nebulous veils of suspended moisture down to the
vivid green of the valley. The mountains seemed
to dissolve into the nothingness above; the stream
was unusually noisy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might see him this evening,&#8221; he observed;
&#8220;and I could find out how Buck was resting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;However did he come to get hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never knew rightly, there we were all standing
with Buckley a-talking, when the stone flew out
of the crowd and hit him on the head. Nobody saw
who did it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you hadn&#8217;t been there, Gordon. You
always seem to be around, to get talked about, when
anything happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw that she was irritable, in a mood for complaint,
and he rose. &#8220;You mean Mrs. Caley talks
wherever I am,&#8221; he corrected. He left the porch
and walked over the road to the village. The store,
he knew, would be closed; but Valentine Simmons,
an indefatigable church worker, almost invariably
after the service pleasantly passed the remainder of
Sunday in the contemplation and balancing of his
long and satisfactory accounts and assets.</p>
<p>He was, as Gordon had anticipated, in the enclosed
office bent over his ledgers. The door to the
store was unlocked. Simmons rose, and briefly acknowledged
Gordon&#8217;s presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was sorry Buckley got hurt,&#8221; the latter opened;
&#8220;it wasn&#8217;t any direct fault of mine. We were having
words. I don&#8217;t deny but that it might have gone
further with us, but some one else stepped in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I was informed. Buckley will probably live&nbsp;...&nbsp;that
is all the Stenton doctor will say; a piece
of his skull has been removed. I am not prepared
to discuss it right now&nbsp;...&nbsp;painful to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. But I didn&#8217;t come to discuss that.
I want to talk to you about the timber&mdash;those options
of Lettice&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t agree to the deal?&#8221; Simmons queried
sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever I say is good enough for Lettice,&#8221; Gordon
replied.</p>
<p>An expression of relief settled over the other.
&#8220;The papers will be ready this week,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
have taken all that, and some expense, off you.
You will make a nice thing out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; Gordon assented heartily. &#8220;And that
reminds me&mdash;I saw an old acquaintance of Pompey
Hollidew&#8217;s in Greenstream to-day. I don&#8217;t know
his name; I drove him up in the stage, and Pompey
greeted him like a long-lost dollar.&#8221;</p>
<p>A veiled, alert curiosity was plain on Simmons&#8217;s
smooth, pinkish countenance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if you know him too?&mdash;a man with
a beard, a great hand for maps and cigars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; Valentine Simmons temporized.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could he have anything to do with those timber
options of the old man&#8217;s, with your offer for them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; Simmons repeated. His face was now
absolutely blank; he sat turned from his ledgers,
facing Gordon, without a tremor.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use, Simmons,&#8221; Gordon Makimmon admitted;
&#8220;I was out by the old mill this morning. I
saw you both, heard something that was said. That
railroad will do a lot for values around here, but
mostly for timber.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instantly, and with no wasted regrets over lost
opportunities, Simmons changed his tactics to meet
existing conditions. &#8220;Your wife&#8217;s estate controls
about three thousand acres of timber,&#8221; he pronounced.
&#8220;What will you take for them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much do you control?&#8221; Gordon asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;About twenty-five hundred at present.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon paused, then, &#8220;Lettice will take thirty dollars
an acre.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; the other protested, &#8220;Pompey bought
them for little or nothing. You&#8217;re after over two
hundred per cent. increase.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you figure to get out of yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t concern us now. I&#8217;ve had to put
this through&mdash;a tremendous thing for Greenstream,
a lasting benefit&mdash;entirely by myself. I will have
to guarantee a wicked profit outside; I stand alone
to lose a big sum. I&#8217;ll give you ten dollars for the
options.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon rose. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see the railroad people myself,&#8221;
he observed; &#8220;and find out what I can do
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on,&#8221; Simmons waved him back to his
chair. &#8220;If there&#8217;s too much talk the thing will get
out. You know these thick skulls around here&mdash;at
the whisper of transportation you couldn&#8217;t cut a
sapling with a gold axe. It took managing to interest
the Tennessee and Northern; they are going
through to Buffalo; a Greenstream branch is only
a side issue to them.&#8221; He paused, thinking.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no good,&#8221; he resumed, &#8220;in you and me getting
into each other. The best thing we can do is
to control all the good stuff, agree on a price, and
divide the take.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon carefully considered this new proposal.
It seemed to him palpably fair. &#8220;All the papers
would have to be made together,&#8221; he added; &#8220;what&#8217;s
for one&#8217;s for the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that the deal was fully exposed Valentine
Simmons was impatient of small precautions.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see how the plan lays?&#8221; he demanded
irritably. &#8220;We&#8217;ll draw up a partnership. Don&#8217;t get
full and talk,&#8221; he added discontentedly. It was
evident that he keenly resented the absence of Pompey
Hollidew from the transaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;A thing like this,&#8221; he informed the other, &#8220;ain&#8217;t
put through in a week. It will be two or three years
yet before the company will be ready for construction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minor details were rehearsed, concluded. Two
weeks later Gordon signed an agreement of partnership
with Valentine Simmons to purchase collectively
such timber options as were deemed desirable,
and to merchandise their interests at a uniform price
to the railroad company concerned.</p>

</div>

<p>When Gordon returned to his dwelling
he found Sim Caley and his sister&#8217;s
husband taking the horse from the
shafts of a dusty, two-seated carriage. Rutherford
Berry was a slightly-built man with high, narrow
shoulders, and a smooth, pasty-white face. He was
clerk in a store at the farther end of Greenstream
valley, and had flat, fragile wrists and a constant,
irritating cough.</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;y, Gord!&#8221; he shouted; &#8220;your sister wanted
to visit with you over night, and see Lettice. We
only brought two&mdash;the oldest and Barnwell K.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;oldest,&#8221; Gordon recalled, was the girl who
had worn Clare&#8217;s silk waist and &#8220;run the colors&#8221;;
Barnwell K. Berry was, approximately, ten.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; he returned cordially. He assisted
in running the carriage back by the shed.
Lettice and his sister were stiffly facing each other
in the sitting room. The latter had a fine, thin
countenance with pale hair drawn tightly back and
fastened under a small hat pinned precariously
aloft; her eyes were steady, like his own. She wore
a black dress ornamented with large carmine dots,
with a scant black ribband about her waist, her sole
adornment a brassy wedding ring, that almost covered
an entire joint. She spoke in a rapid, absent
voice, as if her attention were perpetually wandering
down from the subject in hand to an invisible kitchen
stove, or a child temporarily unaccounted for.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lettice looks right good,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;and,
dear me, why shouldn&#8217;t she, with nothing on her
mind at all but what comes to every woman? When
I had my last Rutherford was down with the influenza,
the youngest was taken with green-sickness,
and we had worked out all our pay at the store in
supplies. You&#8217;re fixed nice here,&#8221; she added without
a trace of envy in her tired voice. &#8220;I suppose
that&#8217;s Mrs. Hollidew in her shroud. We have one
of James&mdash;he died at three&mdash;sitting just as natural
as life in the rocker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Rose?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the kitchen, helping Mrs. Caley. I wanted
to ask that nothing be said before Rose of Lettice&#8217;s
expecting. We&#8217;ve brought her up very delicate;
and besides there&#8217;s a young man paying her attention,
it&#8217;s not a fitting time&mdash;she might take a scare.
I had promised to bring Barnwell K. the next time.&#8221;</p>
<p>They could hear from without the boy and the
hysterical yelping of General Jackson. &#8220;That dog
won&#8217;t bite?&#8221; Mrs. Berry worried. Gordon, patently
indignant, replied that the General never bit.
&#8220;Barnwell might cross him,&#8221; she answered; and,
moving to the door, summoned her offspring. It
was the sturdy individual who had burst into a wail
at Clare&#8217;s funeral, his hair still bristling against a
formal application of soap.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&#8217;m on in, doggy,&#8221; he called; &#8220;c&#8217;m in, Ginral.
I wisht I had a doggy like that,&#8221; he hung on his
mother&#8217;s knees lamenting the absence from their
household of a General Jackson. &#8220;Our ol&#8217; houn&#8217;
dog&#8217;s nothing,&#8221; he asserted.</p>
<p>Lettice, worn by her visitor&#8217;s rapid monotone, the
stir and clatter of young shoes, remarked petulantly,
&#8220;Gordon paid two hundred dollars for that single
dog; there ought to be something extra to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Berry received this item without signal
amazement; it was evident that she was prepared to
credit any vagaries to the possessors of Pompey Hollidew&#8217;s
fabulous legacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just think of that!&#8221; she exclaimed mildly; &#8220;I&#8217;ll
chance that dog gets a piece of liver every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rose, from the door, announced supper. She
was an awkward girl of seventeen, with the pallid
face and blank brown eyes of her father, and diffident
speech. Gordon faced Lettice over her figured
red cloth; on one side Barnwell K. sat flanked by
his mother and Simeon Caley, on the other Rose sat
by an empty chair, the place of the now energetically
employed Mrs. Caley. The great, tin pot of coffee
rested at Lettice&#8217;s hand, and, before Gordon, a portentous
platter held three gaunt, brown chickens with
brilliant yellow legs stiffly in air. Between these
two gastronomic poles was a dish of heaped, quivering
poached eggs, the inevitable gravy boat, steaming
potatoes and a choice of pies. Gordon dismembered
the chickens, and, as the plates circled the
table, they accumulated potatoes and gravy and eggs.
Barnwell K., through an oversight, was defrauded
of the last item, and proceeded to remedy the omission.
He thrust his knife into the slippery, poached
mass. At best a delicate operation, he erred, eggs
slipped, and a thick yellow stream flowed sluggishly
to the rim of the plate. His mother met this fault
of manner with profuse, disconcerted apologies.
She shook him so vigorously that his chair rattled.
Simeon Caley lifted the heavy coffee pot for Lettice.</p>
<p>Mrs. Caley&#8217;s service was abrupt, efficient; she set
down plates of hot bread with a clatter; she rattled
the stove lids from without, and complained of General
Jackson, faithfully following her every movement.</p>
<p>Sim Caley wielded an adroit knife; but, under
the extraordinary pressure of this bountiful repast,
Rutherford Berry easily outdistanced him. He consumed
such unlimited amounts that he gained the
audible displeasure of his wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not a camel,&#8221; she truthfully observed,
&#8220;you don&#8217;t have to fill up for a week; you get something
home. What Lettice&#8217;ll think of you I can&#8217;t
make out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Substantial sections of pie were dispatched.
Barnwell K., valiantly endeavoring to emulate his
father, struggled manfully; he poked the last piece
of crust into his mouth with his fingers. Then, in
a shrill aside, he inquired, &#8220;Will Aunt Lettice have
the baby while we&#8217;re here.&#8221; His mother&#8217;s hand
rang like a shot on his face, and he responded instantly
with a yell of appalling volume.</p>
<p>Lettice&#8217;s cup struck sharply upon its saucer. The
delicate Rose flushed appropriately, painfully. The
culprit was hauled, incontinently, dolefully wailing,
to bed. The three men preserved an embarrassed
silence. Finally Gordon said, &#8220;Have a
cigar.&#8221; His brother-in-law responded with alacrity,
but Sim preferred his plug tobacco, and Gordon
Makimmon twisted a cigarette. Sim and Rutherford
were patently uncomfortable amid the formality
of the dining room; and, at Gordon&#8217;s suggestion,
trooped with relief out to the shedlike stable. There
they examined critically the two horses. Facing the
stalls was an open space, and on boxes and the remnant
of a chair they found places and smoked and
spat informally.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could study a life on women,&#8221; Rutherford
Berry pronounced, &#8220;and never come to any satisfaction.
It seems to me the better they be the more
sharp-like they get. There&#8217;s your sister, Gord&mdash;the
way she does about the house, and with all the
children to tend, is a caution to Dunkards. She
does all you could ask and again. But it just seems
she can&#8217;t be pleasant with it. Now there&#8217;s Nickles,
next place to me, his old woman&#8217;s not worth a pinch
of powder, but she is the nicest, easiest spoken body
you&#8217;d meet in a day on a horse. You mind Effie
when she was young, Gord&mdash;she just trailed song all
over the house, but it wasn&#8217;t hardly a year before she
got penetrating as a musket. Rose is just like her&mdash;she&#8217;s
all taffy now on that young man, but in a
little spell she&#8217;ll clamp down on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon had a swift vision of Lettice sharpening
with the years; there sounded in prospect on his ear
an endless roll of acidulous remarks, accompanied
by the fretful whine of children, intensified by Mrs.
Caley&#8217;s lowering silence. He thought of the change
that had overtaken his sister Effie, remarked by her
husband, the change from a trim, upright figure to
the present stooped form, the turning of that voice
brimming with song to a continuous, shrill troubling.</p>
<p>The cool, disdainful countenance of Meta Beggs
returned to him: time, he divined, would not mark
her in so sorry a fashion; to the last she would remain
slimly rounded, graceful; her hands, like
magnolia flowers, would never thicken and grow rough.
He thought of Paris, of that life which, she said,
would civilize him; he tried in vain to form an image
of the cafés and little carriages, the bare-necked
women drinking champagne. He recalled a burlesque
show he had once seen in Stenton, called &#8220;The
French Widows&#8221;; the revealed amplitude of the
&#8220;widows&#8221; had been clad in vivid, stained pink
tights; the scene in which they disported with a
comic Irishman, a lugubrious Jew, was set with
gilded palms, a saloon bar on one side and a tank
on the other from which &#8220;Venus&#8221; rose flatly from a
cotton sea. He dismissed that possibility of resemblance&mdash;it
was too palpably at variance with
what Meta Beggs would consider desirable; but,
somehow, pink tights and Paris were synonymous in
his thoughts. At any rate it was certain to be gay;
the women would resemble Nickles&#8217; wife rather than
his sister&nbsp;...&nbsp;than Lettice as she would be in a
few years.</p>
<p>He recalled suddenly a neglected rite of hospitality,
and from an obscure angle of the shed, produced
a gallon jug. Drinking vessels were procured, and
a pale, pungent whiskey poured out. Rutherford
Berry sputtered and gasped over his glass; Sim Caley
absorbed a brimming measure between breaths,
without a wink of the eye; Gordon drank inattentively.
The ceremony was repeated; a flare of color
rose in Berry&#8217;s pallid countenance, Sim&#8217;s portion
apparently evaporated from the glass. The whiskey
made no visible impression on Gordon Makimmon.
The jug was circulated again, and again.
All at once Rutherford became drunk. He rose
swaying, attempted to articulate, and fell, half in a
stall. Simeon Caley pulled him out, slapped his
back with a hard, gnarled palm, but was unable to
arouse him from a profound stupor.</p>
<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t right strong,&#8221; Sim observed with a
trace of contempt, propping the figure in a limp
angle against the wall. It was dark now, and he
lit the hand lantern, cautiously closing the door.
Outside the whippoorwills had begun to call. A
determined rattling of pots and pans sounded from
the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much is in her, Gord?&#8221; Sim asked.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon investigated the jug. &#8220;She&#8217;s
near three quarters full,&#8221; he announced.</p>
<p>An expression of profound content settled upon
Simeon Caley. The jug went round and round.
Gordon grew a shade more punctilious than customary,
he wiped the jug&#8217;s mouth before passing it to
Sim&mdash;at the premature retirement of Rutherford the
glasses had been discarded as effete; but not a degree
of the other&#8217;s manner betrayed the influence of
his Gargantuan draughts of liquor. The lantern
flickered on the sloping, cobwebby roof, on the
shaggy horses as they lay clumsily down to rest, on
the crumpled figure of Gordon&#8217;s sister&#8217;s husband.</p>
<p>The potations were suddenly interrupted by a
sharp knocking from without. An expression of
concern instantly banished Sim&#8217;s content; he gazed
doubtfully at the jug, then, as Gordon made no move,
rose and with marked diffidence proceeded to open
the door. The lantern light fell on the gaunt, bitter
countenance of his wife framed in imponderable
night. Her eyes made liquid gleams in the wavering
radiance which, directed at Gordon, seemed to be
visible points of hatred.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s ten o&#8217;clock,&#8221; she said to her husband, &#8220;and
if you hain&#8217;t got enough sense to go to bed I&#8217;ll put
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming right along,&#8221; he assured her pacifically;
&#8220;we were just having a drink around.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Berry&#8217;s asking for her husband,&#8221; she
added, gazing at that insensate form.</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be kind of bad to his stomach,&#8221; Sim
remarked; &#8220;he dropped with nothing &#8217;tall on him.&#8221;
He bent and picked the other up. Rutherford Berry&#8217;s
arms hung limply over Sim&#8217;s grasp, his feet
dragged heavily, in unexpected angles, over the
floor. &#8220;Coming, Gord?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon made no reply. He sat intent upon the
jug before him. Simeon considerately shut the
door. At regular intervals Gordon Makimmon took
a long drink. He drank mechanically, without any
evidence of desire or pleasure; he resembled a man
blindly performing a fatiguing operation in his
sleep; he had the fixed, open eyes of a sleep-walker,
the precise, unnatural movements. The lantern
burned steadily, the horses slept with an audible
breathing. Finally the jug was empty; he endeavored
to drink twice after that was a fact before discovering
it.</p>
<p>He rose stiffly and threw open the door. Dawn
was flushing behind the eastern range; the tops
of the mountains were thinly visible on the brightening
sky. His dwelling, with every window closed,
was silvery with dew. He walked slowly, but without
faltering, to the porch, and mounted the steps
from the sod; the ascent seemed surprisingly steep,
long. The door to the dining room was unlocked
and he entered; in the thinning gloom he could distinguish
the table set as usual, the coffee pot at Lettice&#8217;s
place glimmering faintly. He turned to the
left and passed into their bedroom. The details of
the chamber were growing clear: the bed was placed
against the farther wall, projecting into the room,
its low footboard held between posts that rose slimly
dark against the white counterpane beyond; on the
right were a window and high chest of drawers, on
the left a stand with a china toilet service and a
couch covered with sheep skins, roughly tanned and
untrimmed. A chair by the bed bore Lettice&#8217;s
clothes, another at the foot awaited his own. By
his side a curtain hung out from the wall, forming
a wardrobe.</p>
<p>He vaguely made out the form of Lettice sitting
upright in the bed, her hands clasped about her
knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your brother-in-law,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;is a powerful
spindling man.&#8221; She made no rejoinder to
this, and, after a short pause, he further remarked,
&#8220;How he gets on sociable I don&#8217;t see.&#8221;</p>
<p>His wife&#8217;s eyes were opened wide, gazing intently
into the greying room; not by a sound, a motion, did
she show any consciousness of his presence. He
was deliberate in his movements, very deliberate,
laboriously exact in his mental processes, but they
were ordered, logical. It began to annoy him that
his wife had made no reply to his pleasantries; it
was out of reason; he wasn&#8217;t drunk like Rutherford
Berry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said,&#8221; he pronounced, &#8220;that Berry is a nubbin.
Didn&#8217;t you hear me? haven&#8217;t you got an answer to
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat gazing into nothingness, ignoring him
completely.</p>
<p>His resentment changed to anger; he moved to
the foot of the bed, where, in his shirt sleeves, he
harangued her:</p>
<p>&#8220;I want a cheerful wife, one with a song to her,
and not a dam&#8217; female elder around the house. A
good woman is a&mdash;a jewel, but when your goodness
gives you a face ache it&#8217;s&nbsp;...&nbsp;it&#8217;s something different,
it&#8217;s a nuisance. I&#8217;d almost rather have a wife
that wasn&#8217;t so good but had some give to her.&#8221; He
sat down, clutching a heavy shoe which came off
suddenly. Lettice was as immobile as the chest of
drawers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goddy knows,&#8221; he burst out again, &#8220;it&#8217;s solemn
enough around here anyhow with Sim Caley&#8217;s old
woman like a grave hole, and now you go and get
it too.... Berry might put up with it, and Sim&#8217;s
just fool-hearted, but a regular man wouldn&#8217;t abide
it, he&#8217;d&mdash;he&#8217;d go to Paris, where the women are
civilized and dance all night.&#8221; He muttered an
unintelligible period about French widows and pink....
&#8220;Buried before my time,&#8221; he proclaimed. He
stood with his head grizzled and harsh above an absurdly
flowing nightshirt. In the deepening light
Lettice&#8217;s countenance seemed thinner than usual, her
round, staring eyes were frightened, as though she
had seen in the night the visible apparition of the
curse of suffering laid upon all birth.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look like you&#8217;ve taken leave of your wits,&#8221;
he exclaimed in an accumulated exasperation; &#8220;say
something.&#8221; He leaned across the bed, and,
grasping her elbow, shook her. She was as rigid, as unyielding,
as the bed posts. Then with a long, slow
shudder she turned and buried her head in the pillow.</p>

<p>Rutherford Berry and Effie, Barnwell
K. and the delicate Rose, left after
breakfast. Sim drove off behind the
sturdy horse and Mrs. Caley was audibly energetic
in the kitchen. When Gordon appeared on the
porch Lettice was seated in the low rocker that had
so often held Clare. She responded in a suppressed
voice to her husband&#8217;s salutation. &#8220;You
went and spoiled Effie&#8217;s whole visit,&#8221; she informed
him, &#8220;making Rutherford drunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he protested, &#8220;we never; he just got himself
drunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was mean anyway&mdash;sitting drinking all night
in the stable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll say I was drunk too next.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter to you what I say, or what I
go through with. I&#8217;ve stood more than I rightly
ought, more than I&#8217;m going to&mdash;you must give me
one thought in a day. You just act low. Father
was self-headed, but he was never real trashy. He
never got into fights at those common camp meetings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I threw the stone that hit Buck, didn&#8217;t I! I
busted his head open, didn&#8217;t I! Oh, of course, I&#8217;m
to blame for it all&nbsp;...&nbsp;put it on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how did you get in it? how did you get
mixed up with the school-teacher?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got Mrs. Caley to thank for this, and I&#8217;ll thank
her.&#8221; He hotly recited the obvious aspect of his
connection at the camp meeting with Meta Beggs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds all right as far as it goes,&#8221; she retorted;
&#8220;but I&#8217;ll chance there&#8217;s a good deal more;
I&#8217;ll chance you had it made up to meet her there.
You would never have gone for any other reason;
I don&#8217;t believe you have been to a revival for twenty
years. You had it made up between you. And that
Miss Beggs is too smart for you, she&#8217;ll fool you all
over the mountain. I don&#8217;t like her either, and I
don&#8217;t want you to give her the satisfaction of making
up to you. It&#8217;s what she&#8217;d like&mdash;laughing at my
back!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Beggs never spoke any harm of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She made a gesture, hopeless, impatient, at his innocence.
Her resentment burst out again, &#8220;Why
does she want to speak to you&mdash;another woman&#8217;s
husband? Anybody knows it&#8217;s low down. When
did you see her? What did you talk about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course when I see her coming I ought to go
&#8217;round by South Fork,&#8221; he replied, heavily sarcastic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t have to stand and talk like I
warrant you do. There&#8217;s something deep about her
look.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve taken care of myself for some years, and
I guess I can keep on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can if you want to go to ruin, like you were
when I married you, and you only had one shirt to
your name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Throw it up to me. It&#8217;s no wonder a man
drinks here, he&#8217;s got more to forget than to think
about.&#8221; He stepped from the porch, preparing to
leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; she commanded; &#8220;I&#8217;ll put up with being
left, and having you drink all night with the
beasts, and fooling my money away, but,&#8221; her voice
rose and her eyes burned over dark shadows, &#8220;I
won&#8217;t put up with another woman, I won&#8217;t put up
with that thin thing making over my husband. I
won&#8217;t! I won&#8217;t! do you understand that.... I&mdash;I
can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went around the corner of the house with her
last words ringing in his ears, kicking angrily at the
rough sod. His house, between Mrs. Caley&#8217;s glum
silence and Lettice&#8217;s ceaseless complaining, was becoming
uninhabitable. And, as Rutherford Berry
had pointed out, the latter would only increase,
sharpen, with the years. Lettice was a good wife,
she was not like Nickles&#8217; old woman, worthless but
the pleasantest body you&#8217;d meet in a day on a horse.
She was not like Meta Beggs. He had never seen
any other like the latter. Lettice had said that she
would fool him all over the mountain&nbsp;...&nbsp;but not
him, not Gordon Makimmon, he thought complacently.</p>
<p>He was well versed in the ways of women; he
would not go a step that he did not intend, understand.
This business of Paris, for example: he
might tell Meta Beggs that he&#8217;d go, and then, at&mdash;say,
Norfolk, he would change his mind. Anyhow
that was a plan worth considering. He recalled the
school-teacher&#8217;s level, penetrating gaze; she was as
smart as Lettice had divined; he would have difficulty
in fooling her. He felt obscurely that any step
taken with her would prove irrevocable.</p>
<p>Lettice kept at him and at him; after the baby
arrived it would be no better; there would be others;
he regarded a succession of such periods, a succession
of babies, with marked disfavor. He had been
detached for so long from the restraints of commonplace,
reputable relationships that they grew increasingly
irksome, they chafed the old, established freedom
of morals and action. Meta Beggs blew into
fresh flame the embers of dying years. And yet, as
he had told her by the stream, an involuntary lassitude,
a new stiffness, had fallen upon his desire.
Although his marriage was burdensome it was an
accomplished fact; Lettice&#8217;s wishes, her quality of
steadfastness, exerted their influence upon him.</p>
<p>They operated now to increase his resentment;
they formed an almost detached disapproval situated
within his own breast, a criticism of his thoughts, his
emotions, against which he vainly raged, setting
himself pointedly in its defiance.</p>
<p>He lounged past the Courthouse, past Peterman&#8217;s
hotel, to the post-office. It was a small frame structure,
with the wing of the postmaster&#8217;s residence extending
from the back. At the right of the entrance
was a small show window holding two watches with
shut, chased silver lids, and a small pasteboard box
lined with faded olive-colored plush containing two
plated nut crackers and six picks. The postmaster
was the local jeweller. Within, beyond the window
which gave access to the governmental activities a
glass case rested on the counter. It was filled with
an assortment of trinkets&mdash;rings with large, highly-colored
stones, wedding bands, gold pins and
bangles engraved with women&#8217;s flowery names; and,
laid by itself, a necklace of looped seed pearls.</p>
<p>The latter captured Gordon&#8217;s attention, it was so
pale, and yet, at the same time, so suggestive of elusive
colors; it was so slender and graceful, so finished,
that it irresistibly recalled the person of Meta Beggs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see that string of pearls,&#8221; he requested.</p>
<p>The postmaster laid it on top of the glass case.
&#8220;The jobber sent it up by accident,&#8221; he explained;
&#8220;I can&#8217;t see anything to it&mdash;for the price; it&#8217;s too
slimsy. I wouldn&#8217;t advise it, Gord. Why, for
thirty dollars, and that&#8217;s what it costs&mdash;diamond
clasp, you can get a string of fish skin pearls, experts
can&#8217;t tell &#8217;em from original, as big as your finger end
that would go twice about the neck and then hang
some.&#8221;</p>
<p>The necklace slipped coldly through Gordon Makimmon&#8217;s
hand; it reminded him of a small, pearly
snake with a diamond head; it increasingly reminded
him of Meta Beggs. She loved jewelry. If
she had kissed him for a pair of silk stockings&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll take it,&#8221; he decided slowly; &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know if I&#8217;ve got her right here in my pants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Gordon,&#8221; the other heartily reassured him,
&#8220;whenever you like. Of course it&#8217;s a fine article&mdash;all
strung on gold wire. I won&#8217;t be surprised
but Lettice&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s elegant. I often wondered
why you didn&#8217;t stop in lately and look over my stock;
ladies put a lot on such little trifles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meta Beggs would have to wear it under her dress
in Greenstream, he realized; perhaps she had better
not wear it at all until she was out of the valley.
He would clasp the pearls about that smooth, round
throat.... The postmaster wrapped the pearls
into a small, square package, talking voluminously.
A new driver of the Stenton stage had lost a mail
bag, he had lamed a horse&mdash;a satisfactory driver
had not been discovered since Gordon&nbsp;...&nbsp;left.
He had heard of a law restraining the sale of patent
medicines, of Snibbs&#8217; Mixture, and what the local
drinkers would do, already deprived of the more
legitimate forms of spirituous refreshment, was difficult
to say. The postmaster predicted they would
take to &#8220;dope.&#8221; Then there was to be a sap-boiling
over on the western mountain, to-morrow night, at
old man Entriken&#8217;s.... Everybody had been invited;
if the weather was ugly it would take place
the first clear spell.</p>
<p>Sap-boilings, Gordon knew, held late in spring in
the maple groves, lasted all night. Baskets of food
were driven to the scene; the fires under the great,
iron kettles were kept replenished; everybody stirred
the bubbling sap, ate, gabbled; the young people
even danced on the grass.</p>
<p>It was a romantic ceremonial: the unusual hours
of its celebration, the mystery of night in close groves
lit by the stars temporarily unsettled life from its
prosaic, arduous journey toward the inevitable,
blind termination. It moved the thoughts into unwonted
fantasy, the heart to new, unguessed possibilities.
For that night established values, life-long
habits, negations, prudence, were set at naught.</p>
<p>Gordon wondered whether Meta Beggs would be
there? He would like to be with her at a
sap-boiling, in the sooty shadows. With the necklace of
seed pearls in his pocket he walked over the street revolving
in his mind the problem of asking her to
accompany him. He could not hope to hide it
from Lettice; and, to-day, he had recognized a note
of finality in his wife&#8217;s voice with regard to the
school-teacher. If he went with Meta Beggs serious
trouble would ensue in his home&nbsp;...&nbsp;he wished to
avoid any actual outbreak with Lettice. He remembered,
tardily, her condition; it would be dangerous
for her. He might, conceivably, at some time
or another, go away; even to Paris&mdash;yet, at that
latter thought, the wish, almost the necessity, of a
return lingered at the back of his brain&mdash;but he
would not goad her into an explosion of misery and
temper. He acknowledged to himself, with a faint
glow of pride, that he was not anxious to encounter
Lettice Makimmon&#8217;s full displeasure; she possessed
the capability of tenacity, an iron-like resolve, inherited
from old Pompey.</p>
<p>In the outcome his difficulty was unexpectedly
solved for him&mdash;a large farm wagon, with boards
temporarily laid from side to side, was to convey
a quantity of people, and among them Meta Beggs,
from the village to the sap-boiling. He learned this
from the idlers before the <i>Bugle</i> office. Sitting with
his chair canted against that dingy wooden façade
he thought of the school-teacher and the coming
night. It was late afternoon of the day on which he
had bought the necklace. The small package still
rested in his pocket. It had been his intention to
give the pearls to Meta Beggs before he returned to
his home, but no opportunity had offered. After
school she had passed the seated row of men, uneasily
stirring their hats in response to her collected greeting;
and, with Mrs. Peterman, gone into the body of
the hotel. Gordon could not follow her. Anyhow,
the presentation could be made with better effect in
the obscurity of the maples to-morrow night&nbsp;...&nbsp;her
gratitude could have fuller sweep.</p>
<p>He made his way finally, reluctantly, home.
There, alone in the bedroom, he swiftly withdrew
the necklace from its pasteboard box, and dropped
it into the pocket of a coat hanging in the curtained
wardrobe. It was, he noted, the checked suit with
the red thread, the one he would wear to the sap-boiling.
He heard approaching footsteps, and,
hastily crumpling the paper and small box into a
compact unit, he flung it into a corner of the wardrobe,
behind a heap of linen.</p>

</div>

<p>It was comparatively a short distance to the elder
Entriken&#8217;s farm, and, rather than invent a laborious
explanation of the horse&#8217;s absence all
night, Gordon walked. Numberless excuses offered
him plausible reason for his own delayed return
home.&mdash;It was better to say nothing to Lettice
of his actual intention; she was already suspicious
of his sudden interest in local gatherings.</p>
<p>The road beyond Greenstream village crossed a
brook and mounted by sharp turns the western
range. The day had faded to amethyst, pale in the
translucent vault of the sky, deepening in the valley;
the plum-colored smoke of evening fires ascended
in tenuous columns to an incredible height.
He walked rapidly, with the oppressed heart that
had lately grown familiar, the sense of imminence,
the feeling of advancing into a vague, towering
shadow. That last sensation was at once new and
familiar&mdash;where before had he been conscious of a
vast, indefinable peril, blacker than night, looming
implacably before him? He summoned his old
hardihood and advanced over the still, bosky side of
the mountain.</p>
<p>He descended, beyond the ridge, into the fact of
evening accomplished. At the base of the range he
crossed a softly-swelling expanse of close-cropped
grass, skirted a bog and troop of naked-seeming
birches, and came in view of the maple grove toward
which he was bound.</p>
<p>The maple trees towered compact and majestic
over the level sod, holding their massed foliage
black against the green sky. Low in the right the
new moon hung like a gold fillet above the odorous,
crepuscular earth; and, at the base of the trees, the
fires were like bubbling, crimson sealing wax poured
into the deeper, indigo gloom.</p>
<p>As Gordon advanced he saw a number of vehicles,
from which the horses had been taken and tied to an
improvised railing. Figures moved darkly against
the flames; beyond familiar features flickered like
partial, painted masks on the night. In the grove
the sap, stirred in the great iron kettles, kept up a
constant, choking minor; the smooth trunks of the
trees swept up from the unsteady radiance into the
obscurity of invisible branches looped with silver
strings of stars.</p>
<p>Blurred forms moved everywhere. He searched
for Meta Beggs. She was not by the kettles of sap;
beyond the trees, by covered baskets of provisions
lanterns made a saffron pool of light, but she was not
there. He felt in his pocket the cool, sinuous
necklace. Finally he found her; or, rather, she slipped
illusively into his contracted field of vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t tell me you were coming,&#8221; she reproached
him.</p>
<p>She wore a red dress, purple in the night, with a
narrow, black velvet ribband pinned about her
throat; her straw hat was bound in red. She gained
an extraordinary potency from the dark; it almost
seemed to Gordon Makimmon that her skin had a
luminous quality; he could see her pointed hands
distinctly, and her small, cold face. All her dresses
strained about her provocative body, an emphasis
rather than a covering of her slim maturity. They
drifted, without further speech, out of the circles of
wavering light, into the obscurity beyond.</p>
<p>They sat, resting against a hillock of sod, facing
the sinking visible rim of the moon. From the bog
the frogs sounded like a continuously and lightly-struck
xylophone. Meta Beggs shivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go mad here,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;in this&mdash;this
nothingness. Look&mdash;the moon dropping into wilderness;
other lucky people are watching it disappear
behind great houses and gardens; women in the
arms of their lovers are watching it through silk
curtains.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gazed critically over the valley, the mountains,
into the sky scarfed by night. &#8220;I&#8217;m used to
it,&#8221; he returned; &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t bother me like it does
you. Some people even like it. A man who came
here from the city to die of lung trouble sat for
weeks looking up Greenstream valley; he couldn&#8217;t
get enough morning or evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to die, I want to live. I&#8217;m going
to live, too; I&#8217;ve decided&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To stop teaching. When the term&#8217;s over, in a
few weeks, I&#8217;m going to take the money I make and
go to New York. It will be just enough to get me
there and buy me a pretty hat, with a few dollars
over. I am going with those into a café and get a
bottle of champagne, and pick out the man with
the best clothes. I&#8217;ll tell him I&#8217;m a poor school-teacher
from the South who came to New York to
meet a man who promised to marry me, but who had
not kept his word. I&#8217;ll tell him that I&#8217;m good&mdash;I
can, you know; no man has ever fooled anything out
of me&mdash;and that I bought wine to get the courage to
kill myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds right smart,&#8221; he admitted; &#8220;you can
do it too, you can lie like hell. But,&#8221; he added importantly,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I will let you.&#8221; This,
he assured himself, was purely experimental. He
had decided nothing; his course in the future was
hidden from him absolutely. He thought discontentedly
of his home, of the imagined long, dun vista
of years.</p>
<p>He was now, he realized dimly, at the crucial
point of his existence: with Meta Beggs, in that
world of which Paris was the prefigurement, he
might still wring from life a measure of the sharp
pleasures of tempestuous youth and manhood; he
might still dance to the piping of the senses. With
Lettice in Greenstream he would rapidly sink into
the dullness of increasing age.</p>
<p>He was vaguely conscious of the baseness of the
mere weighing of such a choice; but he was engulfed
in his overmastering egotism; his sense of
obligation was dulled by the supreme selfishness of
a lifetime, of a lifetime of unbridled temper and
appetite, of a swaggering self-esteem which the remorseless
operation of fate had ignored, had passed
indifferently by, leaving him in complete ignorance
of the terrible and grim possibilities of human mischance.</p>
<p>He had suffered at the loss of his dwelling, but
principally it had been his pride that had borne the
wound; Clare&#8217;s death had affected him finally as the
arbitrary removal of a sentimental object for his
care, on which to lavish the gifts of his large generosity.</p>
<p>He sat revolving in his mind the choice of paths
which seemed to open for his decision in such different
directions, which seemed to await the simple ordering
of his footsteps as he chose. The night
deepened to its darkest hour; the moon, in obedience
to its automatic, fixed course, had vanished behind
the mountains; the frogs, out of their slime, raised
their shrill plaint of life in death.</p>

</div>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got something for you,&#8221; Gordon said suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it&#8217;s pretty,&#8221; she replied, leaning
forward, resting against his shoulder.</p>
<p>He brought from his pocket the slender, looped
necklace of seed pearls. It was faintly visible in the
dark, the diamond clasp made a small glint. She
took it eagerly from him. &#8220;I&#8217;ll light a match,&#8221; he
told her. In the minute, orange radiance the pearls
shimmered in her fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s wonderful!&#8221; she exclaimed, unable to
suppress her surprise at his unerring choice; &#8220;it&#8217;s
exactly right. Have you been to Stenton? however
could you get this here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know a few things,&#8221; he assured her; &#8220;I
got an eye. Let me put it on for you.&#8221; He took
it from her, and his hands fumbled about her smooth
throat. He required a long time to fasten it. The
intoxication of the subtlety of her sex welled from
hand to head. He kissed her still lips until he
ceased from sheer lack of breath. He drew her
close to him, with an arm about her pliant waist.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking of you in those pretty clothes,&#8221;
he admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;All lace and webby pink silk and ribbands underneath,&#8221;
she reminded him; &#8220;but only for you,
and satin trains and diamonds for the others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her words winged like little flames into his imagination.
He whispered in her ear, &#8220;Richmond.&#8221;
She stiffened in his arms as if that single word had
the power to freeze her. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see, we&#8217;ll see,&#8221;
he added hastily, fearing to dispel her complacency.
&#8220;Paris is a long way&nbsp;...&nbsp;a man could never come
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you were so cautious,&#8221; she challenged;
&#8220;I thought you were bolder&mdash;that&#8217;s your
reputation in Greenstream, a bad one for a man
or woman to cross.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;ve been,&#8221; he acknowledged; &#8220;I told you I
wouldn&#8217;t have hesitated a while back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is holding you now&mdash;your wife? She
would soon get over it. She&#8217;s only a girl, she hasn&#8217;t
had enough experience to hold a man. Besides, she
must know by now that you only married her for
money; she must know you don&#8217;t care for her;
women always find out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bald, incontestable statement of his reason
for marrying Lettice disconcerted him. He had
never made the acknowledgment of putting it into
words to himself, and no one else had openly
guessed, had dared....</p>
<p>Suddenly it appeared to him in the light of a
possible act of cowardice&mdash;Lettice, a girl, blinded by
affection. And, equally, it was undeniably true that
he did not care for her&nbsp;...&nbsp;he did not care for
her? that realization too carried a slight sting. But
neither did he care for Meta Beggs; something different
attracted him to the latter; she&mdash;she brought
him out, that was it; she ministered to his pleasure,
his desire, his&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; she said firmly.</p>
<p>His balked feelings overmastered him, and he
disregarded her prohibition. She slipped from his
grasp as lithely as the serpentine pearls had run
through his fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you learned,&#8221; she demanded, standing,
&#8220;that I can&#8217;t be bought with silk stockings or a little
necklace? Or, perhaps, you are cheap, and I have
been entirely wrong.... I&#8217;m going to get something
to eat, with the people who brought me from
Greenstream. I will be back here in two hours, but
it will be for the last time. You must decide one
way or the other while I am gone. You may stay or
leave; I&#8217;m going to leave. Remember&mdash;no more
penny kisses, no more meetings like this; it must be
all or nothing. Some man will take me to Paris,
have me.&#8221; She dissolved against the dark of the
maple grove.</p>

</div>

<p>But, curiously, sitting alone, he gave little
consideration to the decision, immediate and
irrevocable, which confronted him. His
thoughts evaded, defied, him, retreated into night-like
obscurity, returned burdened with trivial and
unexpected details of memory. It grew colder, the
rich monotone of mountain and sky changed to an
impenetrable, ugly density above which the constellations
wheeled without color. His back was toward
the maple grove; the removed, disembodied
voices mingled in a sound not more intelligible than
the chorus of frogs. It occurred to him suddenly
that, perhaps, in a week, a month, he might not be
in Greenstream, nor in the mountains, but with the
white body of Meta Beggs in the midst of one of
those vast, fabulous cities the lust of which possessed
her so utterly.... Or she would be gone.</p>
<p>He thought instinctively of the little cemetery on
the slope above the village. One by one that rocky
patch was absorbing family and familiars. Life
appeared to be a stumbling procession winding
through Greenstream over the rise and sinking into
that gaping, insatiable chasm. He was conscious
of an invisible force propelling him into that sorry
parade, toward those unpretentious stones marked
with the shibboleth of names and dates. A desperate
anxiety to evade this fate set his soul cowering in
its fatal mask of clay. This, he realized, was unadulterated,
childish fear, and he angrily aroused
himself from its stifling influence.</p>
<p>Meta Beggs would be back soon; she would require
an answer to her resolve&nbsp;...&nbsp;all or nothing.
The heat, chilled by the night and loneliness, faded
a little from his blood. She demanded a great deal&mdash;a
man could never return. He bitterly cursed his
indecision. He became aware of a pervading weariness,
a stiffness from his prolonged contact with the
earth, and he rose, moved about. His legs were as
rigid, as painful, as an old man&#8217;s; he had been leaning
on his elbow, and the arm was dead to the fingers.
The nerves pricked and jerked in infinitesimal,
fiery agonies. He swung his arms, stamped his
feet, aiding his stagnating circulation. The frogs
ceased their complaint abruptly; the concerted jangle
of voices in the grove rose and fell. The replenished
fires poured their energy over the broad bottoms
of the sap kettles.</p>
<p>The night faded.</p>
<p>The change, at first, was imperceptible: as always
the easterly mountains grow visible against a
lighter sky. The foliage of the maples, stripped of
the looping stars, took the form of individual
branches brightening from black to green. There
was a stir of dim figures about the impatient horses.
Meta Beggs came swiftly to him. He could see her
face plainly now, and was surprised at its strained,
anxious expression. Her hand closed upon his arm,
she drew him to her:</p>
<p>&#8220;Which?&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he dully replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Save me,&#8221; she implored; &#8220;take me away.&#8221; She
whispered maddeningly in his ear, summoning the
lust within him, the clamor in his brain, the throbbing
in his throat, his wrists. He shut his eyes, and,
when he opened them, the dawn had arrived. It
forced her from him. Her gown changed to vivid
red; about her throat the graceful pearls were faintly
iridescent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he repeated wearily.</p>
<p>Over her shoulder he saw a buggy approaching
across the grass. It was disconcertingly familiar,
until he recognized, beyond any doubt, that it was
his own. Sim, he assured himself, had learned of
his presence at the sap-boiling, and, in passing, had
stopped to fetch him home. But there was no man
in the buggy&nbsp;...&nbsp;only two women. Meta Beggs,
intercepting his intent gaze, turned and followed it
to its goal&nbsp;...&nbsp;Gordon saw now that Mrs. Caley
was driving, and by her side&nbsp;...&nbsp;Lettice! Lettice&mdash;riding
over the rough field, over the dark stony
roads, when now, so soon&nbsp;...&nbsp;in her condition&nbsp;...&nbsp;it
was insanity. Simeon Caley&#8217;s wife should
never have allowed it.</p>
<p>The horse, stolidly walking over the sod, stopped
before them. Mrs. Caley held a rein in either hand,
her head, framed in a rusty black bonnet and strings,
was as dark, as immobile as iron. Lettice gathered
her shawl tightly about her shoulders; she had on a
white waist and her head was bare. She descended
clumsily from the buggy and walked slowly up to
Gordon. Her face was older than he had ever seen
it, and pinched; in one hand she grasped a small
pasteboard box.</p>
<hr class='major' />

</div>

<p>Gordon Makimmon made one step toward
her. Lettice held the box in an extended
hand:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gordon,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;what was this for? It
was in the clothes press last evening: it couldn&#8217;t have
been there long. You see&mdash;it&#8217;s a little jewellery
box from the post-office; here is the name on the lid.
Somehow, Gordon, finding it upset me; I couldn&#8217;t
stop &#8217;til I&#8217;d seen you and asked you about it. Somehow
there didn&#8217;t seem to be any time to lose. I
asked for you last night in the village, but everybody
had gone to the sap-boiling&nbsp;...&nbsp;I sat up all night&nbsp;...&nbsp;waiting&nbsp;...&nbsp;I couldn&#8217;t wait any longer, Gordon,
somehow. I had to come out and find you,
and everybody had gone to the sap-boiling, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Lettice,&#8221; he stammered, more disconcerted
by the sudden loss of youth from her countenance
than by her words; &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t&mdash;wasn&#8217;t much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was it, Gordon?&#8221; she insisted.</p>
<p>Suddenly he was unable to lie to her. Her questioning
eyes held a quality that dispelled petty and
casual subterfuges. The evasion which he summoned
to his lips perished silently.</p>
<p>&#8220;A string of pearls,&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you crush the pretty box if they were
for&mdash;for me or for your sister, if it was to be a
surprise? I can&#8217;t understand&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It, it was&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who were they for, Gordon?&#8221;</p>
<p>A blundering panic swept over him; Lettice was
more strange than familiar; she was unnatural; her
hair didn&#8217;t shine in the sunlight streaming into the
shallow, green basin; in the midst of the warm efflorescence
she seemed remote, chill.</p>
<p>&#8220;For her,&#8221; he moved his head toward Meta Beggs.</p>
<p>She withdrew her burning gaze from Gordon Makimmon
and turned to the school-teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;For Miss Beggs,&#8221; she repeated, &#8220;why&nbsp;...&nbsp;why,
that&#8217;s bad, Gordon. You&#8217;re married to me; I&#8217;m
your wife. Miss Beggs oughtn&#8217;t&nbsp;...&nbsp;she isn&#8217;t anything
to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meta Beggs stood motionless, silent, her red cotton
dress drawing and wrinkling over her rounded
shoulders and hips. The necklace hung gracefully
about the slender column of her throat.</p>
<p>The two women standing in the foreground of
Gordon Makimmon&#8217;s vision, of his existence,
summed up all the eternal contrast, the struggle, in
the feminine heart. And they summed up the
duplicity, the weakness, the sensual and egotistical desires,
the power and vanity and vain-longing, of
men.</p>
<p>Meta Beggs was the mask, smooth and sterile, of
the hunger for adornment, for gold bands and jewels
and perfume, for goffered linen and draperies of
silk and scarlet. She was the naked idler stained
with antimony in the clay courts of Sumeria; the
Paphian with painted feet loitering on the roofs of
Memphis while the blocks of red sandstone floated
sluggishly down the Nile for the pyramid of Khufu
the King; she was the flushed voluptuousness relaxed
in the scented spray of pagan baths; the
woman with piled and white-powdered hair in a
gold shift of Louis XIV; the prostitute with a
pinched waist and great flowered sleeves of the Maison
Doree. She was as old as the first vice, as the
first lust budding like a black blossom in the morbidity
of men successful, satiated.</p>
<p>She was old, but Lettice was older.</p>
<p>Lettice was more ancient than men walking cunning
and erect, than the lithe life of sun-heated
tangles, than the vital principle of flowering plants
fertilized by the unerring chance of vagrant insects
and airs.</p>
<p>Standing in the flooding blue flame of day they
opposed to each other the forces fatally locked in the
body of humanity. Lettice, with her unborn child,
her youth haggard with apprehension and pain, the
prefigurement of the agony of birth, gazed, dumb
and bitter in her sacrifice, at the graceful, cold figure
that, as irrevocably as herself, denied all that
Lettice affirmed, desired all that she feared and
hated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s bad, Gordon,&#8221; she reiterated, &#8220;I&#8217;m
your wife. And Miss Beggs is bad, I&#8217;m certain of
that.&#8221; A spasm of suffering crossed her face like a
cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought not to have come, Lettice. Lettice,
you ought not to have come,&#8221; he told her. His dull
voice reflected the lassitude that had fallen upon him,
the sudden death of all emotion, the swift extinguishing
of his interest in the world about him; it reflected,
in his indifference to desire, an indifference
to Meta Beggs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you love her, Gordon?&#8221; his wife asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; he answered, perceptibly impatient
at the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like her better than you like me?&#8221;</p>
<p>The palpable answer to her query, that he thought
of himself more than either, evaded him. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
like her better than I like you,&#8221; he repeated baldly.</p>
<p>Lettice turned to the other woman. &#8220;There&#8217;s not
much you can say,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;caught like this
trying to steal somebody&#8217;s husband. And you set
over a school of children!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t choose to be,&#8221; Meta Beggs retorted. &#8220;I
hate it, but I had to live. If you hadn&#8217;t had all that
money to keep you soft, yes, and get you a husband,
you would have had to fight and do, too. You
might have been teaching a roomful of little sneaks,
and sick to death of it before ever you began&nbsp;...&nbsp;or
you might be on the street&mdash;better girls have than
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you bought her a necklace, Gordon, her&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>All that he now desired was to get Lettice safely
home. Another wave of pain rose whitely over her
countenance. &#8220;Come on, Lettice,&#8221; he urged; &#8220;just
step into the buggy.&#8221; He waved toward the vehicle,
toward the peacefully grazing horse, Mrs. Caley sitting
upright and sallow.</p>
<p>&#8220;And take him right along with you,&#8221; Meta
Beggs added; &#8220;your money&#8217;s tight around his neck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Resentment at the implied ignominy penetrated
his self-esteem.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going right on now, Lettice,&#8221; he continued;
&#8220;we must drive as careful as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I want you,&#8221; his wife articulated
slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can decide that later,&#8221; he returned; &#8220;we&#8217;re
going home first.&#8221;</p>
<p>She relaxed her fingers, and dropped the pasteboard
box on the turf. She stood with her arms
hanging limply, breathing in sharp inspirations.
She gazed about at the valley, the half-distant maple
grove: suddenly the youth momentarily returned to
her, the frightened expression of a child abruptly
conscious of isolation in an alien, unexpected setting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gordon,&#8221; she said rapidly, &#8220;I had to come&mdash;find
you&nbsp;...&nbsp;something&mdash;&#8221; her voice sharpened
with apprehension. &#8220;Tell me it will be all right.
It won&#8217;t&nbsp;...&nbsp;kill me.&#8221; She stumbled toward him,
he caught her, and half carried her to the buggy,
where he lifted her over the step and into the seat.
A red-clad arm was supporting her on the other side:
it was Meta Beggs.</p>
<p>&#8220;You drive,&#8221; he directed Mrs. Caley. He held
Lettice with her face hidden against his shoulder.
The valley was refulgent with early summer, the
wheat was swelling greenly, the meadows, threaded
by shining streams were sown with flowers, grazed
by herds of cattle with hides like satin, the pellucid
air was filled with indefinite birdsong. The buggy
lurched over a hillock of grass, his wife shuddered
in his arms, and an unaccustomed, vicarious pain
contracted his heart. Where the fields gave upon
the road the buggy dropped sharply; Lettice cried
out uncontrollably. He cursed Mrs. Caley savagely
under his breath, &#8220;Can&#8217;t you drive,&#8221; he asked;
&#8220;can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The ascent to the crown of the ridge was rough,
but beyond, winding down to the Greenstream valley,
it was worse. The buggy, badly hitched, bumped
against the flank of the horse, twisted over exposed
boulders, brought up suddenly in the gutters cut diagonally
by the spring torrents. Gordon Makimmon
forgot everything else in the sole desire to get
Lettice safely to their house. He endeavored, by
shifting her position, to reduce the jarring of the
uneven progress. He realized that she was in a
continual agony, and, in that new ability to share it
through the dawning consciousness of its brute actuality
in Lettice, it roused in him an impotent fury
of rebellion. It took the form of an increasing passion
of anger at the inanimate stones of the road,
against Mrs. Caley&#8217;s meager profile on the dusty
hood of the buggy. He whispered enraged oaths,
worked himself into an insanity of temper. Lettice
grew rigid in his arms. For a while she iterated
dully, like the beating of a sluggish heart &#8220;bad&nbsp;...&nbsp;bad&nbsp;...&nbsp;bad.&#8221; Then dread wiped all other expression
from her face; then, again, pain pinched
her features.</p>
<p>The buggy creaked down the decline to their
dwelling. Gordon supported Lettice to their room;
then he stood on the porch without, waiting. The
rugged horse, still hitched, snatched with coarse, yellow
teeth at the grass. Suddenly Mrs. Caley appeared
at a door: she spoke, breaking the irascible
silence of months, dispelling the accumulating ill-will
of her pent resentment, with hasty, disjointed
words:</p>
<p>&#8220;... quick as you can&nbsp;...&nbsp;the doctor.&#8221;</p>

<h2>XIX</h2>
</div>

<p>A hoarse, thin cry sounded from within
the Makimmon dwelling. It fluctuated
with intolerable pain and died abruptly
away, instantly absorbed in the brooding calm of the
valley, lost in the vast, indifferent serenity of noon.
But its echo persisted in Gordon&#8217;s thoughts and emotions.
He was sitting by the stream, before his
house; and, as the cry had risen, he had moved
suddenly, as though an invisible hand had touched
him upon the shoulder. He sat reflected on the sliding
water against the reflection of the far, blue sky.
One idea ran in a circle through his brain, his lips
formed it soundlessly, he even spoke it aloud:</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t as though I had gone,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The possible consequence to Lettice of what had
been a mere indecision seemed to him out of any
proportion. No, he thought, I wouldn&#8217;t have gone
when the time came; when the minute came I&#8217;d have
held back. Then again, it ain&#8217;t as though I had
gone. A species of surprise alternated with resentment
at the gravity of the situation which had resulted
from his indiscreet conduct; the agony of that
cry from within the house was too deep to have
proceeded from&nbsp;...&nbsp;it wasn&#8217;t as though he had gone&nbsp;...&nbsp;he
wouldn&#8217;t have gone, anyway.</p>
<p>He heard footsteps on the porch, and turned, recognizing
Doctor Pelliter. He half rose to go to the
other with an inquiry; but he dropped quickly back
on the bank, looked away.&mdash;Some time before the
doctor had tied a towel about his waist&nbsp;...&nbsp;it had
been a white towel.</p>
<p>His mind returned to Lettice and the terrible
mischance that had been brought upon her; that he
had brought on her. He tested the latter clause,
and attempted to reject it: he had done nothing to
provoke such a terrible actuality. He rehearsed the
entire chain of events which had resulted in the purchase
of the pearl necklace; he followed it as far
back as the evening when, from the minister&#8217;s lawn,
he had seen Meta Beggs undressing at her window.
He could nowhere discover any desperate wrong
committed. He knew men, plenty of them, who
were actually unfaithful to their wives: he had done
nothing of that sort. He endeavored to grow infuriated
with Meta Beggs, then with Mrs. Caley; he
endeavored to place upon them the responsibility for
that attenuated, agonized sound from the house; but
without success. He had made a terrible blunder.
But, in a universe where the slightest fairness ruled,
he and not Lettice would pay for an error purely his
own.</p>
<p>Lettice was so young, he realized suddenly.</p>
<p>He recalled her as she sat alone, under the lamp,
with her shawl about her shuddering shoulders, waiting
for the inevitable, begging him to assure her that
it would be all right. It would, of course, be all
right in the end. It must! Then things would be
different. He made himself no extravagant promises
of reform, no fevered reproaches; but things
would be different.&mdash;He would take Lettice driving;
he had the prettiest young wife in Greenstream, and
he would show people that he realized it. She had
been Lettice Hollidew, the daughter of old Pompey,
the richest man in the county.</p>
<p>The importance of that latter fact had dimmed;
the omnipotence of money had dwindled: for instance,
any conceivable sum would be powerless to
still that cry from within. In a way it had risen
from the very fact of Pompey Hollidew&#8217;s fortune&mdash;Meta
Beggs would never have considered him aside
from it. He endeavored to curse the old man&#8217;s
successful avarice, but without any satisfaction.
Every cause contributing to the present impending
catastrophe led directly back to himself, to his indecision.
The responsibility, closing about him,
seemed to shut out the air from his vicinity, to make
labored his breathing. He put out a hand, as
though to ward off the inimical forces everywhere
pressing upon him. He had seen suffering
before&mdash;what man had not?&mdash;but this was different; this
unsettled the foundations of his being; it found him
vulnerable where he had never been vulnerable before;
he shrunk from it as he would shrink from
touching a white-hot surface. He was afraid
of it.</p>
<p>He thought of the ghastly activities inside the
house; they haunted him in confused, horrid details
amid which Lettice suffered and cried out.</p>
<p>He was unaware of the day wheeling splendidly
through its golden hours, of the sun swinging across
the narrow rift of the valley. At long intervals he
heard muffled hoof-beats passing on the dusty road
above. He watched a trout slip lazily out from under
the bank, and lie headed upstream, slowly waving
its fins. It recalled the trout he had left on the
porch of Hollidew&#8217;s farmhouse on the night when he
had attempted to&nbsp;...&nbsp;seduce&nbsp;...&nbsp;Lettice!</p>
<p>The details of that occasion returned vivid, complete,
unsparing. It was a memory profoundly regrettable
because of an obscure connection with Lettice&#8217;s
present danger; it too&mdash;although he was unable
to discover why it should&mdash;took on the dark
aspect of having helped to bring the other about.
As the memory of that night recurred to him he became
conscious of an obscure, traitorous force lurking
within him, betraying him, leading his complacency
into foolish and fatal paths, into paths
which totally misrepresented him.... He would
not really have gone away with Meta Beggs.</p>
<p>He was a better man than all this would indicate!
Yet&mdash;consider the result; he might as well have
committed a foul crime. But, in the end, it would be
all right. Doctors always predicted the darkest possibilities.</p>
<p>He turned and saw Doctor Pelliter striding up the
slope to where his team was hitched on the public
road. A swift resentment swept over Gordon Makimmon
as he realized that the other had purposely
avoided him. He rose to demand attention, to call;
but, instinctively, he stifled his voice. The doctor
stopped at the road, and saw him. Gordon waved
toward the house, and the other nodded curtly.</p>

<p>He passed through the dining room to the
inner doorway, where he brushed by Mrs.
Caley. Her face was as harsh and
twisted as an old root. He proceeded directly to the
bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lettice,&#8221; he said; &#8220;Lettice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he saw the appalling futility of addressing
that familiar name to the strange head on the pillow.</p>
<p>Lettice had gone: she had been destroyed as utterly
as though a sinister and ruthless magic had
blasted every infinitesimal quality that had been
hers. A countenance the color of glazed white paper
seemed to hold pools of ink in the hollows of its eyes.
The drawn mouth was the color of stale milk.
Nothing remained to summon either pity or sorrow.
The only possible emotion in the face of that revolting
human disaster was an incredulous and shocked
surprise. It struck like a terrible jest, a terrible,
icy reminder, into the forgetful warmth of living;
it mocked at the supposed majesty of suffering,
tore aside the assumed dignity, the domination, of
men; it tampered ferociously with the beauty, the
pride, the innocent and gracious pretensions, of
youth, of women.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon was conscious of an overwhelming
desire to flee from the white grimace on
the bed that had been Lettice&#8217;s and his. He drew
back, in a momentary, abject, shameful cowardice;
then he forced himself to return.... The fleering
lips quivered, there was a slight stir under the counterpane.
A little sound gathered, shaped into words
barely audible in the stillness of the room broken
only by Gordon&#8217;s breathing:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&nbsp;...&nbsp;too much. Not any more&nbsp;...&nbsp;hurting.
Oh! I can&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He found a chair, and sat down by her side. The
palms of his hands were wet, and he wiped them
upon his knees. His fear of the supine figure grew,
destroying the arrogance of his manhood, his sentient
reason. He was afraid of what it intimated,
threatened, for himself, and of its unsupportable
mockery. He felt as an animal might feel cornered
by a hugely grim and playful cruelty.</p>
<p>The westering sun fell through a window on the
disordered huddle of Lettice&#8217;s hastily discarded
clothes streaming from a chair to the floor&mdash;her
stockings, her chemise threaded with a narrow blue
ribband. His thoughts turned to the little white
garments she had fashioned in vain.</p>
<p>It had been wonderfully comfortable in the evening
in the sitting room with Lettice sewing. He
recalled the time when he had first played the phonograph
in order to hear the dog &#8220;sing.&#8221; Lettice had
cried out, imploring him to stop; well&mdash;he had
stopped, hadn&#8217;t he? The delayed realization of her
patience of misery rankled like a barb. The wandering
thoughts returned to the long fabrication he
had told her of the loss of his money in Stenton,
of the fictitious agent of hardware. He had snared
the girl in a net of such lies; scornful of Lettice&#8217;s
innocence, her &#8220;stupid&#8221; trust, he had brought her to
this ruinous pass. It hadn&#8217;t been necessary.</p>
<p>The window was open, and a breath of early summer
drifted in&mdash;a breath of palpable sweetness.
Mrs. Caley entered and bent over the bed, an angular,
black silhouette against the white. She left
without a word.</p>
<p>If Lettice died he, Gordon Makimmon, would
have killed her, he had killed more&nbsp;...&nbsp;he recognized
that clearly. The knowledge spread through
him like a virus, thinning his blood, attacking his
brain, his nerves. He lifted a shaking hand to wipe
his brow; and, for a brief space, his arm remained in
air; it looked as though he were gazing beneath a
shielding palm at a far prospect. The arm dropped
suddenly to his side, the fingers struck dully against
the chair. He heard again the muffled beat of
horse&#8217;s hoofs on the road above; the sun moved
slowly over the narrow, gay strips of rag carpet on
the floor: life went on elsewhere.</p>
<p>His fear changed to loathing, to absolute, sick repulsion
from all the facts of his existence. With
the passing minutes the lines deepened on his haggard
countenance, his expression perceptibly aged.
The stubble of beard that had grown since the day
before grizzled his lean jaw; the confident line of
his shoulders, of his back, was bowed.</p>
<p>He looked up with a start to find the doctor once
more in the room. He rose. &#8220;Doc,&#8221; he asked in
a strained whisper, &#8220;Doc, will it be all right?&#8221; He
wet his lips. &#8220;Will she live?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t whisper,&#8221; the other told him; &#8220;she
doesn&#8217;t know&nbsp;...&nbsp;now. &#8216;Will she live?&#8217; I can
only tell you that she wanted to die a thousand
times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon turned away, looking out through the window.
It gave upon the slope planted with corn; the
vivid, green shoots everywhere pushed through the
chocolate-colored soil; chickens were vigorously
scratching in a corner. The shadow of the west
range reached down and enfolded the Makimmon
dwelling; the sky burned in a sulphur-yellow flame.
When he turned the doctor had vanished, the room
had grown dusky. He resumed his seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t do right,&#8221; he acknowledged to the
travesty on the bed; &#8220;there was a good bit I didn&#8217;t get
the hang of. It seems like I hadn&#8217;t learned anything
at all from being alive. I&#8217;m going to fix it
up,&#8221; he proceeded, painfully earnest. &#8220;I&#8217;m&mdash;&#8221;
He broke off suddenly at the stabbing memory of
the doctor&#8217;s words, &#8220;She wanted to die a thousand
times.&#8221; He thought, I&#8217;ve killed her a thousand
times already. The fear plucked at his throat. He
rose and walked unsteadily to the door and out upon
the porch.</p>
<p>The evening drew its gauze over the valley, the
shrill, tenuous chorus of insects had begun for the
night, the gold caps were dissolving from the eastern
peaks. He saw Simeon Caley at the stable door;
Sim avoided him, moving behind a corner of the
shed. His pending sense of blood-guiltiness deepened.
The impulse returned to flee, to vanish in the
engulfing wild of the mountains. But he realized
vaguely that that from which he longed to escape
lay within him, he would carry it&mdash;the memories
woven inexplicably of past and present, dominated
by this last, unforgettable specter on the bed&mdash;into
the woods, the high, lonely clearings, the still valleys.
It was not remorse now, it was not simple fear, but
the old oppression, increased a thousand-fold.</p>
<p>He sat in the low rocking chair that had held
his mother and Clare, and, only yesterday, Lettice,
and its rockers made their familiar tracking sound
over the uneven boards of the porch. At this hour
there was usually a stir and smell of cooking from
the kitchen; but now the kitchen window was blank
and still. Darkness gathered slowly about him; it
obscured the black and white check, the red thread,
of his suit; it flowed in about him and reduced him
to the common greyness of the porch, the sod, the
stream. It changed him from a man with a puzzled,
seamed visage into a man with no especial, perceptible
features, and then into a shadow, an inconsequential
blur less important than the supports for
the wooden covering above.</p>

</div>

<p>After a while he rose, impelled once more
within. A lamp had been lit in the bedroom,
and, in its radiance, the countenance
on the pillow glistened like the skin of a lemon. As
before, Mrs. Caley left the room as he entered; and
he thought that, as she passed him, she snarled like
an animal.</p>
<p>He sat bowed by the bed. A moth perished in
the flame of the lamp, and the light flickered through
the room&mdash;it seemed that Lettice grimaced, but it
was only the other. Her face had grown sharper:
it was such a travesty of her that, somehow, he
ceased to associate it with Lettice at all. Instead
he began to think of it as something exclusively of
his own making&mdash;it was what he had done with
things, with life.</p>
<p>The sheet lay over the motionless body like a thin
covering of snow on the turnings of the earth; it
defined her breasts and a hip as crisply as though
they were cut in marble effigy on a tomb of youthful
dissolution. He followed the impress of an arm to
the hand; and, leaning forward, touched it. A
coldness seemed to come through the cover to his fingers.
He let his hand stay upon hers&mdash;perhaps the
warmth would flow back into the cold arm, the chill
heart; perhaps he could give her some of his vitality.
The possibility afforded him a meager comfort, instilled
a faint glow into his benumbed being. His
hand closed upon that covered by the linen like a
shroud. He sat rigid, concentrated, in his effort,
his purpose. The light flickered again from the
fiery perishing of a second moth.</p>
<p>A strange feeling crept over him, a deepened sense
of suspense, of imminence. He fingered his throat,
and his hand was icy where it touched his burning
face. He stood up in an increasing, nameless disturbance.</p>
<p>A faint spasm crossed the drained countenance beneath
him; the mouth fell open.</p>
<p>He knew suddenly that Lettice was dead.</p>
<p>There her clothes lay strewn on the chair and
floor, the long, black stockings and the rumpled
chemise strung with narrow blue ribband. She had
worn them on her warm, young body; she had tied
the ribband in the morning and untied it at night,
untied it at night&nbsp;...&nbsp;it was night now.</p>
<p>A slow, exhausted deliberation of mind and act
took the place of his late panic. He smoothed the
sheet where he had grasped her hand in the futile
endeavor to instil into her some of his warmth.
He gazed at her for a moment, at the shadows like
pools of ink poured into the caverns of her eyes, at
a glint of teeth no whiter than the rest, at the dark
plait of her hair lying sinuously over the pillow.
Then he went to the door:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Caley,&#8221; he pronounced. The woman appeared
in the doorway from the kitchen. &#8220;Mrs.
Caley,&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;Lettice is dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>She started forward with a convulsive gasp, and
he turned aside and walked heavily out onto the
porch. He stood for a moment gazing absently into
the darkened valley, at the few lights of Greenstream
village, the stars like clusters of silver grapes
on high, ultra-blue arbors. The whippoorwills
throbbed from beyond the stream, the stream itself
whispered in a pervasive monotone. The first
George Gordon Makimmon, resting on the porch
of his new house isolated in the alien wild, had heard
the whippoorwills and the stream. Gordon&#8217;s father
had heard them just as he, the present Makimmon,
heard them sounding in the night. But no
other Makimmon would ever listen to the persistent
birds, the eternal whisper of the water, because he,
the last, had killed his wife&nbsp;...&nbsp;he had killed
their child.</p>
<p>He trod down the creaking steps to the soft, fragrant
sod, and made his way to where a thread of
light outlined the stable door. Sim was seated on
a box, the lantern at his feet casting a pale flicker
over his riven face and the horse muzzling the
trough. Gordon sat down upon the broken chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s dead,&#8221; he said, after a minute. Simeon
Caley made no immediate reply, and he repeated in
exactly the same manner:</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sudden bitterness of contempt flamed in the
other&#8217;s ineffable blue eyes. &#8220;God damn you to
hell!&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;now you got the money and
nothing to hinder you.&#8221;</p>
<p>His resentment vanished as quickly as it had appeared.
He rose and picked up the lantern, and
with their puny illumination they went out together
into the dark.</p>

<p>On an afternoon of the second autumn following
Lettice&#8217;s death Gordon was fetching
home a headstall resewn by Peterman.
The latter, in a small shed filled with the penetrating
odor of dressed leather at the back of the hotel, exercised
the additional trade of saddler. General
Jackson ambled at Gordon&#8217;s heel.</p>
<p>The dog had grown until his shoulder reached
the man&#8217;s knee; he was compact and powerful, with
a long, heavy jaw and pronounced, grave whiskers;
the wheaten color of his legs and head had lightened,
sharply defining the coarse black hair upon his back.</p>
<p>October was drawing to a close: the autumn had
been dry, and the foliage was not brilliantly colored,
but exhibited a single shade of dusty brown that,
in the sun, took the somber gleams of clouded gold.
It was warm still, but a furtive wind, stirring the
dead leaves uneasily over the ground, was momentarily
ominous, chill.</p>
<p>The limp rim of a felt hat obscured Gordon&#8217;s
features, out of the shadow of which protruded
his lean, sharp chin. His heavy shoes, hastily
scraped of mud, bore long cuts across the heels,
while shapeless trousers, a coat with gaping pockets,
hung loosely about his thin body and bowed shoulders.
He passed the idlers before the office of the
<i>Bugle</i> with a scarcely perceptible nod; but, farther
on, he stopped before a solitary figure advancing
over the narrow footway.</p>
<p>It was Buckley Simmons. He was noticeably
smaller since his injury at the camp meeting; he had
shrivelled; his face was peaked and wrinkled like
the face of a very old man; the shadows in the
sunken cheeks did not resemble those on living skin,
but were dry and dusty like the autumn leaves. His
gaze was fixed upon the ground at his feet; but, as
he drew up to Gordon, he raised his head.</p>
<p>Into the dullness of his eyes, his slack lips, crept a
dim recognition; among the ashes of his consciousness
a spark glowed&mdash;a single, live coal of bitter
hate.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you, Buckley?&#8221; Gordon pronounced
slowly.</p>
<p>The other&#8217;s hands clenched as the wave of
emotion crossed the blank countenance. Then the
hands relaxed, the face was again empty. He continued,
oblivious of Gordon&#8217;s salutation, of his presence,
upon his way.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon stood for a moment gazing
after him. Then, as he turned, he saw that there
was a small group of men on the Courthouse lawn;
he saw the sheriff standing facing them from the
steps, gesticulating.</p>
<hr class='major' />

</div>

<p>The purpose of this gathering was instantly
apparent to him, it stirred obscure memories
into being.&mdash;A property was being
publicly sold for debt.</p>
<p>The trooping thoughts of the past filled his mind;
thoughts, it seemed to him, of another than himself.
Surely it had been another Gordon Makimmon that,
sitting before the <i>Bugle</i> office, had heard the sheriff
enumerating the scant properties of the old freehold
by the stream to satisfy the insatiable greed of
Valentine Simmons. It had been a younger man
than himself by fifteen years. Yet, actually, it had
been scarcely more than three years since the storekeeper
had had him sold out.</p>
<p>That other Makimmon had been a man of incredibly
vivid interests and emotions. Now it appeared
to him that, in all the world, there was not a
cause for feeling, not an incentive to rouse the mind
from apathy.</p>
<p>Stray periods reached him from the sheriff&#8217;s recounting
of &#8220;a highly desirable piece of property.&#8221;
His loud, flat voice had not changed by an inflection
since he had &#8220;called out&#8221; Gordon&#8217;s home; the
merely curious or materially interested onlookers
were the same, the dragging bidding had, apparently,
continued unbroken from the other occasion.
The dun, identical repetition added to the overwhelming
sense of universal monotony in Gordon
Makimmon&#8217;s brain. He turned at the corner, by
Simmons&#8217; store, while the memories faded; the customary
greyness, like a formless drift of cloud obscuring
a mountain height, once more descended
upon him.</p>
<p>At the back of the store a small open space was
filled with broken crates, straw and boxes&mdash;the
debris of unpacking. And there he saw a youthful
woman sitting with her head turned partially from
the road. As he passed a suppressed sob shook her.
It captured his attention, and, with a slight, involuntary
gasp, he saw her face. The memories
returned in a tumultuous, dark tide&mdash;she reminded
him vividly of Lettice. It was in the young curve
of her cheeks, the blue of her eyes, and a sameness
of rounded proportions, that the resemblance lay.</p>
<p>He stopped, without formulated reason, and in
spite of her obvious desire for him to proceed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hardly fit to sit here and cry before the whole
County,&#8221; he observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole County knows,&#8221; she returned in the
egotism of youthful misery.</p>
<p>Her voice, too, was like Lettice&#8217;s&mdash;sweet with
the premonition of the querulous note that, Rutherford
Berry had once said, distinguished all good
women.</p>
<p>A sudden intuition directed his gaze upon the
Courthouse lawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re selling you out,&#8221; he hazarded, &#8220;for
debt.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded, with trembling lips. &#8220;Cannon is,&#8221;
she specified.</p>
<p>Cannon was the storekeeper for whom his brother-in-law
clerked. He thought again, how monotonous,
how everlastingly alike, life was. &#8220;You just
let the amount run on and on,&#8221; he continued; &#8220;you
got this and that. Then, suddenly, Cannon wanted
his money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes opened widely at his prescience. &#8220;But
there was sickness too,&#8221; she added; &#8220;the baby died.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; Gordon said curtly. The lines in his worn
face deepened, his mouth was inscrutable.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been for that,&#8221; she confided, &#8220;we
could have got through. Everything had started
fine. Alexander&#8217;s father had left him the place:
there isn&#8217;t a better in the Bottom. Alexander says
Mr. Cannon has always wanted it. Now&nbsp;...&nbsp;now&nbsp;...&#8221; her blue gaze blurred with slow tears.</p>
<p>Her similarity to Lettice grew still more apparent&mdash;she
presented the same order, her white
shirtwaist had been crisply ironed, her shoes were rubbed
bright and neatly tied. He recalled this similitude
suddenly, and it brought before him a clearly defined
vision of Lettice, not as his wife, but of the girl he
had driven to and from the school at Stenton. He
had not thought of that Lettice for months, for three
years; not since before she had died; not, he corrected
himself drearily, since he had killed her.
He had remembered the last phase, of the glazed and
bloodless travesty of her youth. But even that
lately had been lost in the fog of nothingness settling
down upon him.</p>
<p>And now this girl, on a box back of Simmons&#8217;
store, brought the buried memories back into light.
They disconcerted him, sweeping through the lassitude
of his mind; they stirred shadowy specters of
fear.... The voice of the sheriff carried to them,
describing the excellent repair of incidental sheds.</p>
<p>&#8220;I nailed all the tar-paper on the&mdash;the chicken
house,&#8221; she told him in a fresh accession of unhappiness,
the tears spilling over her round, flushed
cheeks.</p>
<p>It annoyed him to see her cry: it was as though
Lettice was suffering again from old misery. His
irritation grew at this seeming renewal of what had
gone; it assumed the aspect of an intentional reproach,
of Lettice returned to bother him with her
pain and death. He turned sharply to continue on
his way. But, almost immediately, he stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your name?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adelaide Crandall.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Crandalls, he knew, were a reputable family
living in the valley bottom east of Greenstream village.
Matthew Crandall had died a few years before,
and, as this girl had indicated, had left a substantial
farm to each of his sons. Cannon would
get this one, and it was more than probable, the
others.</p>
<p>The old enmity against Valentine Simmons, directed
at Cannon, flamed afresh. Simmons or the
other&mdash;what did the name matter? they were the
same, a figurative apple press crushing the juice out
of the country, leaving but a mash of hopes and
lives. He stood irresolute, while Adelaide Crandall
fought to control her emotions.</p>
<p>The badgering voice of the sheriff sounded again
on his hearing. He crossed the road, pushed open
the grinding iron gate of the fence that enclosed the
Courthouse lawn, and made his way through the
sere, fallen leaves to the steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-seven hundred and ninety
dollars,&#8221; the sheriff reiterated; &#8220;only
twenty-seven ninety&nbsp;...&nbsp;this fine bottom
land, all cleared and buildings in best repair. Going!
Going!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three thousand,&#8221; a man called from the group
facing the columned portico.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three thousand! Three thousand! Sale must
be made. Going&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty-one hundred,&#8221; Gordon pronounced
abruptly.</p>
<p>A stir of renewed interest animated the sale.
Gordon heard his name pronounced in accents of
surprise. He was surprised at himself: his bid had
been unpremeditated&mdash;it had leaped like a flash of
ignited powder out of the resurrected enmity to Valentine
Simmons, out of the memories stirred by the
figure that resembled Lettice.</p>
<p>The sheriff immediately took up his bid.
&#8220;Thirty-one hundred! thirty-one, gentlemen; only
thirty-one for this fine bottom land, all cleared&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a prolonged pause in the bidding,
during which even the auctioneer grew apathetic. He
repeated the assertion that the buildings were in the
best repair; then, abruptly, concluded the sale. Gordon
had purchased the farm for thirty-one hundred
dollars.</p>
<p>He despatched, in the Courthouse, the necessary
formalities. When he emerged the group on the
lawn had dwindled to three people conversing intently.
A young man with heavy shoulders already
bowed, clad in unaccustomed, stiff best clothes, advanced
to meet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Makimmon,&#8221; he began; &#8220;you got my
place.... There&#8217;s none better. I&#8217;ve put a lot of
work into it. I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll get my things out soon&#8217;s
I can. If you can give me some time; my wife&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can give you a life,&#8221; Gordon replied brusquely.
He walked past Alexander Crandall to his wife.
She turned her face from him. He said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You go back to the Bottom. I&#8217;ve fixed Cannon&nbsp;...&nbsp;this
time. Tell your husband he can pay me
when it suits; the place is yours.&#8221; He swung on his
heel and strode away.</p>

</div>

<p>The fitful wind had, apparently, driven the
warmth, the sun, from the earth. The
mountains rose starkly to the slaty sky.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon lighted a lamp in the dining
room of his dwelling. The table still bore a red,
fringed cloth, but was bare of all else save the
castor, most of the rings of which were empty. The
room had a forlorn appearance, there was dust
everywhere; Gordon had pitched the headstall into
a corner, where it lay upon a miscellaneous, untidy
pile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you want something to eat,&#8221; he observed
to General Jackson. He proceeded, followed
by the dog, to the kitchen. It revealed an
appalling disorder: the stove was spotted with
grease, grey with settled ashes; a pile of ashes and
broken china rose beyond; on the other side coal and
wood had been carelessly stored. A table was laden
with unwashed dishes, unsavory pots, crusted pans.</p>
<p>Gordon stood in the middle of the floor, a lamp
in his hand, surveying the repellent confusion. It
had accumulated without attracting his notice; but
now, suddenly detached from the aimless procession
of the past months, it was palpable to him, unendurable.
&#8220;It&#8217;s not fit for a dog,&#8221; he pronounced.</p>
<p>An expression of determination settled on his
seamed countenance; he took off his coat and hung
it on a peg in the door. Outside, by an ash-pit,
he found a bucket and half-buried shovel. A minute
after the kitchen was filled with grey clouds as
he shoveled the ashes into the bucket for removal.
He worked vigorously, and the pile soon disappeared;
the wood and coal followed, carried out to
where a bin was built against the house. Then he
raked the fire from the stove.</p>
<p>It was cold within, but Gordon glowed with the
heat of his energy. He filled a basin with water,
and, with an old brush and piece of sandsoap, attacked
the stove. He scrubbed until the surface
exhibited a dull, even black; then, in a cupboard, he
discovered an old box of stove polish, and soon the
iron was gleaming in the lamplight. He laid and
lit a fire, put on a tin boiler of water for heating;
and then carried all the movables into the night.
After which he fed General Jackson.</p>
<p>He flooded the kitchen floor and scrubbed and
scraped until the boards were immaculate. Then,
with a wet towel about a broom, he cleaned the walls
and ceiling; he washed the panes of window glass.
The dishes followed; they were dried and ranged
in rigid rows on the dresser; the pots were scoured
and placed in the closets underneath. Now, he
thought vindictively, when he had finished, the
kitchen would suit even Sim Caley&#8217;s wife&mdash;the old
vinegar bottle.</p>
<p>The Caleys had left his house the morning following
Lettice&#8217;s funeral. Mrs. Caley had departed
without a word; Sim with but a brief, awkward
farewell. Since then Gordon had lived alone in the
house; but he now realized that it was not desirable,
practicable. Things, he knew, would soon return
to the dirt and disorder of a few hours ago. He
needed some one, a woman, to keep the place decent.
His necessity recalled the children of his sister....
There was only Rose; the next girl was too young
for dependence. The former had been married a
year now, and had a baby. Her husband had been
in the village only the week before in search of employment,
which he had been unable to secure, and
it was immaterial where in the County they lived.</p>

</div>

<p>The couple grasped avidly at the opportunity
to live with him. The youth had already
evaporated from Rose&#8217;s countenance; her
minute mouth and constantly lifted eyebrows expressed
an inwardly-gratifying sense of superiority,
an effect strengthened by her thin, affected
speech. Across her narrow brow a fringe of hair
fell which she was continually crimping with an iron
heated in the kitchen stove, permeating the room
with a lingering and villainous odor of burned hair.</p>
<p>William Vibard was a man with a passion&mdash;the
accordion. He arrived with the instrument in a
glossy black paper box, produced it at the first opportunity,
and sat by the stove drawing it out to
incredible lengths in the production of still more
incredible sounds. He held one boxlike end, with
its metallic stops, by his left ear, while his right
hand, unfalteringly fixed in the strap of the other
end, operated largely in the region of his stomach.</p>
<p>He had a book of instructions and melodies
printed in highly-simplified and explanatory bars,
which he balanced on his knee while he struggled in
their execution.</p>
<p>He was a youth of large, palpable bones, joints
and knuckles; his face was long and preternaturally
pale, and bore an abstracted expression which deepened
almost to idiocy when bent above the quavering,
unaccountable accordion.</p>
<p>The Vibard baby was alarmingly little, with a
bluish face; and, as if in protest against her father&#8217;s
interminable noise, lay wrapped in a knitted red
blanket without a murmur, without a stir of her
midgelike form, hour upon hour.</p>

<p>Some days after the Vibards&#8217; arrival Gordon
Makimmon was standing by the stable door,
in the crisp flood of midday, when an ungainly
young man strode about the corner of the
dwelling and approached him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Makimmon,&#8221; he half queried, half asserted.
&#8220;I&#8217;m Edgar Crandall, Alexander&#8217;s
brother.&#8221; He took off his hat, and passed his hand
in a quick gesture across his brow. He had close-cut,
vivid red hair bristling like a helmet over a
long, narrow skull, and a thrusting grey gaze. &#8220;I
came to see you,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;because of what
you did for Alec. I can&#8217;t make out just what it was;
but he says you saved his farm, pulled it right out
of Cannon&#8217;s fingers, and that you&#8217;ve given him all
the time he needs to pay it back&mdash;&#8221; He paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Gordon responded, &#8220;and if I did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I studied over it at first,&#8221; the other frankly admitted;
&#8220;I thought you must have a string tied to
something. I know Alexander&#8217;s place, it&#8217;s a good
farm, but&nbsp;...&nbsp;I studied and studied until I saw
there couldn&#8217;t be more in it than what appeared. I
don&#8217;t know why&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should you?&#8221; Gordon interrupted
brusquely, annoyed by this searching into the reason
for his purchase of the farm, into the region of his
memories.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t come here to ask questions,&#8221; the other
quickly assured him; &#8220;but to borrow four thousand
dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not forty?&#8221; Gordon asked dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I couldn&#8217;t put it out at profit, now.&#8221;
Edgar Crandall ignored the other&#8217;s factitious manner:
&#8220;but I can turn four over two or three times
in a reasonable period. I can&#8217;t give you any security,
everything&#8217;s covered I own; that&#8217;s why I came
to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You heard I was a fool with some money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t ask any security of Alexander,&#8221; he
retorted. &#8220;No, I came to you because there was
something different in what you did from all I had
ever known before. I can&#8217;t tell what I mean; it had
a&mdash;well, a sort of big indifference about it. It
seemed to me perhaps life hadn&#8217;t got you in the fix
it had most of us; that you were free.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must think I&#8217;m free&mdash;with four thousand
dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Apples,&#8221; the other continued resolutely. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got the ground, acres of prime sunny slope. I&#8217;ve
read about apple growing and talked to men who
know. I&#8217;ve been to Albermarle County. I can do
the same thing in the Bottom. Ask anybody who
knows me if I&#8217;ll work. I can pay the money back
all right. But, if I know you from what you did,
that&#8217;s not the thing to talk about now.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want a chance,&#8221; he drove a knotted fist into
a hardened palm; &#8220;I want a chance to bring out
what&#8217;s in me and in my land. I want my own!
The place came to me clear, with a little money; but
I wasn&#8217;t content with a crop of fodder. I improved
and experimented with the soil till I found out what
was in her. Now I know; but I can&#8217;t plant a sapling,
I can&#8217;t raise an apple, without binding myself
to the Cannons and Hollidews of the County for
life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be their man, growing their fruit, paying
them their profits. They would stop at the fence,
behind their span of pacers, and watch me&mdash;their
slave&mdash;sweating in the field or orchard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to think,&#8221; Gordon observed, &#8220;that
you ought to have some special favor, that what
grinds other men ought to miss you. Old Pompey
sold out many a better man, and grabbed richer
farms. And anyhow, if I was to money all that
Cannon and Valentine Simmons got hold of where
would I be?&mdash;Here&#8217;s two of you in one family, in
no time at all.... If that got about I&#8217;d have five
hundred breaking the door in.&#8221;</p>
<p>The animation died from Edgar Crandall&#8217;s face;
he pulled his hat over the flaming helmet of hair.
&#8220;I might have known such things ain&#8217;t true,&#8221; he
said; &#8220;it was just a freak that saved Alec. There&#8217;s
no chance for a man, for a living, in these dam&#8217;
mountains. They look big and open and free, but
Greenstream&#8217;s the littlest, meanest place on the
earth. The paper-shavers own the sky and air.
Well, I&#8217;ll let the ground rot, I won&#8217;t work my guts
out for any one else.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned sharply and disappeared about the
corner of the dwelling. Gordon moved to watch
him stride up the slope to where a horse was tied
by the public road. Crandall swung himself into
the saddle, brought his heels savagely into the
horse&#8217;s sides, and clattered over the road.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon&#8217;s annoyance quickly evaporated;
he thought with a measure of amusement of
the impetuous young man who was not content to
grow a crop of fodder. If the men of Greenstream
all resembled Edgar Crandall, he realized, the Cannons
would have an uneasy time. He thought of
the brother, Alexander, of Alexander&#8217;s wife, who
resembled Lettice, and determined to drive soon to
the Bottom and see them and the farm. He would
have to make a practicable arrangement with regard
to the latter, secure his intention, avoid question, by
a nominal scheme of payment.</p>

</div>

<p>He knew, generally, where Alexander Crandall&#8217;s
farm lay; and, shortly after, drove
through the village and mounted the road
over which plied the Stenton stage. In the Bottom,
beyond the east range, he went to the right and
passed over an ill-defined way with numerous and
deep fords. It was afternoon; an even, sullen expanse
of cloud hid the deeps of sky through which
the sun moved like a newly-minted silver dollar. A
sharp wind drew through the opening; the fallen
leaves rose from the road in sudden, agitated whirling;
the gaunt branches, printed sharply on the curtain
of cloud, revealed the deserted nests of past
springs.</p>
<p>He drove by solitary farms, their acres lying open
and dead among the brush; and stopped, undecided,
before a fenced clearing that swept back to the
abrupt wall of the range, against which a low house
was scarcely distinguishable from the sere, rocky
ascent. Finally he drove in, over a faintly marked
track, past a corner of the fence railed about a trough
for sheep shearing, to the house. A pine tree stood
at either side of the large, uncut stone at the threshold;
except for a massive exterior chimney the somberly
painted frame structure was without noticeable
feature.</p>
<p>He discovered immediately from the youthful
feminine figure awaiting him at the door that he
was not at fault. Mrs. Crandall&#8217;s face radiated her
pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Makimmon!&#8221; she cried; &#8220;there&#8217;s just no
one we&#8217;d rather see than you. Step right out, and
Alexander&#8217;ll take your horse. He&#8217;s only at the back
of the house.... Alec!&#8221; she called; &#8220;Alec, what
do you suppose?&mdash;here&#8217;s Mr. Makimmon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alexander Crandall quickly appeared, in a hide
apron covered with curlings of wood. A slight concern
was visible upon his countenance, as though he
expected at any moment to see revealed the &#8220;string&#8221;
of which his brother had spoken.</p>
<p>Gordon adequately met his salutation, and turned
to the woman. He saw now that she was more
mature than Lettice: the mouth before him, although
young and red, was bitten in at the corners; already
the eyes gazed through a shadow of care; the capable
hands were rough and discolored from toil and
astringent soaps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, come in,&#8221; Crandall urged, striving to
banish the sudden anxiety from his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you go right around, Alec,&#8221; his wife added,
&#8220;and twist the head off that dominicker chicken.
Pick some flat beans too, there&#8217;s a mess still hanging
on the poles. Go in, Mr. Makimmon.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was ushered into the ceremonious, barely-furnished,
best room. There was a small rag carpet
at the door, with an archaic, woven animal, and
at its feet an unsteady legend, &#8220;Mary&#8217;s Little
Lamb&#8221;; but the floor was uncovered, and the walls,
sealed in resinous pine, the pine ceiling, gave the
effect, singular and depressing, of standing inside a
huge box.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mortal cold here,&#8221; Mrs. Crandall truthfully
observed; &#8220;the grate&#8217;s broken. If you wouldn&#8217;t
mind going out into the kitchen&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>In the kitchen, from a comfortable place by the
fire, Gordon watched her deft preparations for an
early supper. Crandall appeared with the picked
dominicker, and sat rigidly before his guest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite make out,&#8221; he at last essayed,
&#8220;how you expect your money, what you want out of
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want anything out of it,&#8221; Gordon replied
with an almost bitter vigor; &#8220;leastways not
any premium. I said you could pay me when you
liked. I&#8217;ll deed you the farm, and we&#8217;ll draw up
a paper to suit&mdash;to suit crops.&#8221;</p>
<p>The apprehension in Alexander Crandall&#8217;s face
turned to perplexed relief. &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221;
he admitted; &#8220;but I haven&#8217;t got to. It&#8217;s enough to
know that you pulled us out of ruination. Things
will come right along now; we can see light; I&#8217;m
extending the sheep-cots twice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Supper at an end he too launched upon the lack of
opportunity in Greenstream. &#8220;Some day,&#8221; he asserted,
&#8220;and not so far off either, we&#8217;ll shake off the
grip of these blood-money men; we&#8217;ll have a state
lawed bank; a rate of interest a man can carry without
breaking his back. There&#8217;s no better land than
the Bottom, or the higher clearings for grazing&nbsp;...&nbsp;it&#8217;s
the men, some of &#8217;em....&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>It was dark when Gordon closed the stable door
and turned to his dwelling. A light streamed
from a chink in the closed kitchen shutter like a
gold arrow shot into the night. From within came
the long-drawn quaver of William Vibard&#8217;s performance
of the Arkansas Traveller. He was sitting
bowed over the accordion, his jaw dropped, his
eyes glazed with the intoxication of his obsession.
Rose was rigidly upright in a straight chair, her
hands crossed at the wrists in her meager lap.</p>
<p>The fluctuating, lamentable sounds of the instrument,
Rose&#8217;s expression of conscious virtue, were
suddenly petty, exasperating; and Gordon, after a
short acknowledgment of their greeting, proceeded
through the house to the sitting room beyond.</p>
<p>No fire had been laid in the small, air-tight stove;
the room had a closed, musty smell, and was more
chill than the night without; his breath hung before
him in a white vapor. Soon he had wood burning
explosively, the stove grew rapidly red hot and the
chill vanished. He saw beyond the lamp with its
shade of minute, variously-colored silks the effigy of
Mrs. Hollidew dead. Undisturbed in the film of
dust that overlaid the table stood a pink celluloid
thimble&nbsp;...&nbsp;Lettice had placed it there....</p>
<p>His thoughts turned to Alexander Crandall and
his wife, to the extended sheep-cots, and the
&#8220;light&#8221; which they now saw. He recalled the former&#8217;s
assertion that the land was all right, but that
the blood-money men made life arduous in Greenstream.
He remembered Edgar Crandall&#8217;s arraignment
of the County as &#8220;the littlest, meanest place
on earth,&#8221; a place where a man who wanted his own,
his chance, was helpless to survive the avarice of a
few individuals, the avarice for gold. He had
asked him, Gordon Makimmon, to give him that
chance. But, obviously, it was impossible&nbsp;...&nbsp;absurd.</p>
<p>His memory drifted back to the evening in the
store when Valentine Simmons had abruptly demanded
payment of his neglected account, to the
hopeless rage that had possessed him at the realization
of his impotence, of Clare&#8217;s illness. That
scene, that bitter realization of ruin, had been repeated
across the breadth of Greenstream. As a
boy he had heard men in shaking tones curse Pompey
Hollidew; only last week the red-headed Crandall
had sworn he would let his ground rot rather
than slave for the breed of Cannon. It was, apparently,
a perpetual evil, an endless burden for the
shoulders of men momentarily forgetful or caught in
a trap of circumstance.</p>
<p>Yet he had, without effort, without deprivation,
freed Alexander Crandall. He could have freed
his brother, given him the chance his rebellious soul
demanded, with equal ease. He had not done that
last, he had said at the time, because of the numbers
that would immediately besiege him for assistance.
This, he realized, was not a valid objection&mdash;the
money was his to dispose of as he saw fit. He possessed
large sums lying at the Stenton banks, automatically
returning him interest, profit; thrown in
the scale their weight would go far toward balancing
the greed of Valentine Simmons, of Cannon.</p>
<p>He considered these facts totally ignorant of the
fact that they were but the reflection of his own inchoate
need born in the anguish of his wife&#8217;s death;
he was not conscious of the veering of his sensibility&mdash;sharpened
by the hoarse cry from the stiffening
lips of Lettice&mdash;to the world without. He
thought of the possibility before him neither as a
scheme of philanthropy nor of revenge, nor of rehabilitation.
He considered it solely in the light
of his own experience, as a practical measure to give
men their chance, their own, in Greenstream. The
cost to himself would be small&mdash;his money had
faded from his conceptions, his necessities, as absolutely
as though it had been fairy gold dissolved by
the touch of a magic wand. He had never realized
its potentiality; lately he had ignored it with the
contempt of supreme indifference. Now an actual
employment for it occupied his mind.</p>
<p>The stove glowed with calorific energy; General
Jackson, who had been lying at his feet, moved farther
away. The lamplight grew faint and reddish,
and then expired, trailing a thin, penetrating odor.
In the dark the heated cylinder of the stove shone
rosy, mysterious.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon was unaware of his own
need; yet, at the anticipation of the vigorous course
certain to follow a decision to use his money in opposition
to the old, established, rapacious greed, he
was conscious of a sudden tightening of his mental
and physical fibers. The belligerent blood carried
by George Gordon Makimmon from world-old
wars, from the endless strife of bitter and rugged
men in high, austere places, stirred once more
through his relaxed and rusting being.</p>
<p>He thought, aglow like the stove, of the struggle
that would follow such a determination, a struggle
with the pink fox, Valentine Simmons. He thought
of himself as an equal with the other; for, if Simmons
were practised in cunning, if Simmons were
deep, he, Gordon Makimmon, would have no necessity
for circuitous dealing; his course would be
simple, unmistakable.&mdash;He would lend money at,
say, three per cent, grant extensions of time wherever
necessary, and knock the bottom out of the storekeepers&#8217;
usurious monopoly, drag the farms out of
Cannon&#8217;s grasping fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;By God!&#8221; he exclaimed, erect in the dark; &#8220;but
Edgar Crandall will get his apples.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dog licked his hand, faithful, uncomprehending.</p>

<p>On an afternoon of mid-August Gordon was
sitting in the chamber of his dwelling that
had been formerly used as dining room.
The table was bare of the castor and the red cloth,
and held an inkpot, pens upright in a glass of shot,
and torn envelopes on an old blotter. An iron safe
stood against the wall at Gordon&#8217;s back, and above it
hung a large calendar, advertising the Stenton
Realty and Trust Company.</p>
<p>A sudden gloom swept over the room, and Gordon
rose, proceeded to the door. A bank of purple
cloud swept above the west range, opened in the sky
like a gigantic, menacing fist; the greenery of the
valley was overcast, and a white flash of lightning,
accompanied by a shattering peal of thunder,
stabbed viciously at the earth. There was no rain.
An edge of serene light followed in the west a band
of saffron radiance that widened until the cloud had
vanished beyond the eastern peaks. The sultry heat
lay like a blanket over Greenstream.</p>
<p>He turned back into the room, but, as he moved,
he was aware of a figure at the porch door. It was
a man with a round, freshly-colored countenance,
bland eyes, and a limp mustache, clad in leather
boots and a worn corduroy gunning coat. Gordon
nodded familiarly; it was the younger Entriken from
the valley beyond.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came to see you about my note,&#8221; he announced
in a facile candor; &#8220;I sh&#8217;d take it up this month, but
times are terrible bad, Gordon, and I wondered if
you&#8217;d give me another extension? There&#8217;s no real
reason why you sh&#8217;d wait again; I reckon I could
make her, but it would certainly be accommodating&mdash;&#8221; he
paused interrogatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Gordon hesitated, &#8220;I&#8217;m not in a hurry
for the note, if it comes to that. But the fact is&nbsp;...&nbsp;I&#8217;ve
got a lot of money laid out. What&#8217;s been
the matter?&mdash;the weather has been good, it&#8217;s rained
regular&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it,&#8221; Entriken interrupted; &#8220;it&#8217;s
rained too blamed regular. It is all right for crops,
but we&#8217;ve got nothing besides cattle, and steers
wouldn&#8217;t hardly put on anything the past weeks.
Of course, in a way, grass is cattle, but it just seems
they wouldn&#8217;t take any good in the wet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it will be all right,&#8221; Gordon Makimmon
assented; &#8220;but I can hardly have the money
out so long&nbsp;...&nbsp;others too.&#8221;</p>

<p>The heat thickened with the dusk. The wailing
clamor of William Vibard&#8217;s accordion
rose from the porch. He had, of late,
avoided sitting with Rose and her husband; they
irritated him in countless, insignificant ways.
Rose&#8217;s superiority had risen above the commonplace
details of the house; she sat on the porch and regarded
Gordon with a strained, rigid smile. After
a pretense at procuring work William Vibard had
relapsed into an endless debauch of sound. His
manner became increasingly abstracted; he ate, he
lived, with the gestures of a man playing an accordion.</p>
<p>The lines on Gordon&#8217;s thin, dark face had multiplied;
his eyes, in the shadow of his bony forehead,
burned steady, pale blue; his chin was resolute; but
a new doubt, a constant, faint perplexity, blurred
the line of his mouth.</p>
<p>From the road above came the familiar sound of
hoof-beats, muffled in dust, but it stopped opposite
his dwelling; and, soon after, the porch creaked
under slow, heavy feet, and a thick, black-clad figure
knocked and entered.</p>
<p>It was the priest, Merlier.</p>
<p>In the past months Gordon had been conscious of
an increasing concord with the silent clerical. He
vaguely felt in the other&#8217;s isolation the wreckage
of an old catastrophe, a loneliness not unlike his,
Gordon Makimmon&#8217;s, who had killed his wife and
their child.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Nickles,&#8221; the priest pronounced, sudden
and harsh, &#8220;are worthless, woman and man. They
would be bad if they were better; as it is they are
only a drunken charge on charity and the church.
They have been stewed in whiskey now for a month.
They make nothing amongst their weeds.&mdash;Is it
possible they got a sum from you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Six weeks back,&#8221; Gordon replied briefly; &#8220;two
hundred dollars to put a floor on the bare earth and
stop a leaking roof.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lies,&#8221; Merlier commented. &#8220;When any one
in my church is deserving I will tell you myself. I
think of an old woman now, but ten dollars would
be a fortune.&#8221; Silence fell upon them. Then:</p>
<p>&#8220;Charity is commanded,&#8221; he proceeded, &#8220;but out
of the hands of authority it is a difficult and treacherous
virtue. The people are without comprehension,&#8221;
he made a gesture of contempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;With age,&#8221; the deliberate voice went on, &#8220;the
soul grows restless and moves in strange directions,
struggling to throw off the burden of flesh. But I
that know tell you,&#8221; Merlier paused at the door, &#8220;the
charity of material benevolence, of gold, will cure
no spiritual sores; for spirit is eternal, but the flesh
is only so much dung.&#8221; He stopped abruptly,
coughed, as though he had carried his utterance beyond
propriety. &#8220;The Nickles,&#8221; he repeated somberly,
&#8220;are worthless; they make trouble in my
parish; with money they make more.&#8221;</p>

<p>The year, in the immemorial, minute shifting
of season, grew brittle and cold; the dusk
fell sooner and night lingered late into
morning.</p>
<p>William Vibard moved with his accordion from
the porch to beside the kitchen stove. He was in
the throes of a new piece, McGinty, and Gordon
Makimmon was correspondingly surprised when, as
he was intent upon some papers, Rose&#8217;s husband
voluntarily relinquished his instrument, and sat in
the room with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter,&#8221; Gordon indifferently inquired;
&#8220;is she busted?&#8221;</p>
<p>William Vibard indignantly repudiated that possibility.
A wave of purpose rose to the long, corrugated
countenance, but sank, without finding expression
in speech. Finally Gordon heard Rose calling
her husband. That young man twitched in his
chair, but he made no other move, no answer. Her
voice rose again, sharp and urgent, and Gordon observed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Your wife&#8217;s a-calling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard her, but I&#8217;d ruther sit right where I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>She appeared in the doorway, flushed and angry.</p>
<p>&#8220;William,&#8221; she commanded, &#8220;you come straight
out here to the kitchen. I got a question for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay just where I am for a spell,&#8221; he replied,
avoiding her gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do as I tell you right off.&#8221;</p>
<p>A stubborn expression settled over his face and
shoulders. He made her no further reply. Rose&#8217;s
anger gathered in a tempest that she tried in vain to
restrain.</p>
<p>&#8220;William,&#8221; she demanded, &#8220;where is it? It&#8217;s
gone, you know what.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t seen it,&#8221; he answered finally; &#8220;I really
ain&#8217;t, Rose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a story, only you knew. Come out
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get along,&#8221; Gordon interrupted testily. &#8220;How
can I figure in this ruction?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t agoing a step,&#8221; William told them both;
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to stop right here with Uncle Gordon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; the latter insisted, &#8220;get it through
with&mdash;what is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what it is,&#8221; William Vibard stammered;
&#8220;it&#8217;s a hundred and forty dollars Rose held
out on you and kept in a drawer, that&#8217;s what!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rose&#8217;s emotion changed to a crimson consternation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, William Vibard! what an awful thing to
say. What little money I had put by was saved
from years. What a thing to say about me and
Uncle Gordon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t no such thing you saved it; you held it
out on him, dollars at a time. You didn&#8217;t have no
more right to it than I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon&#8217;s gaze centered keenly upon his niece&#8217;s hot
face. She endeavored to sustain, refute, the accusation
successfully; but her valor wavered, broke.
She disappeared abruptly. He surveyed Vibard
without pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a ramshackle contraption,&#8221; he observed
crisply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got as good a right to it as her,&#8221; the other
repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;A hundred and forty dollars,&#8221; Gordon said bitterly;
&#8220;that&#8217;s a small business. Well, where is it?
Have you got it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I ain&#8217;t,&#8221; William exploded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t never tell what might happen,&#8221; the
young man observed enigmatically; &#8220;the bellowses
wear out dreadful quick, the keys work loose like,
and then they might stop making them. It&#8217;s the best
one on the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What scrabble&#8217;s this? What did you do with
the money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re in the stable,&#8221; William Vibard answered
more obscurely than before. &#8220;With good
treatment they ought to last a life. They come
cheaper too like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon relinquished all hope of extracting any
meaning from the other&#8217;s elliptical speech. He rose.
&#8220;If &#8216;they&#8217;re&#8217; in the stable,&#8221; he announced, &#8220;I&#8217;ll soon
have some sense out of you.&#8221; He procured a lantern,
and tramped shortly to the stable, closely followed
by Rose&#8217;s husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now!&#8221; he exclaimed, loosening the hasp of the
door, throwing it open.</p>
<p>The former entered and bent over a heap in an
obscure corner. When he rose the lantern shone on
two orderly piles of glossy black paper boxes. Gordon
strode across the contracted space and wrenched
off a lid.... Within reposed a brand new accordion.
There were nine others.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; William eagerly interposed; &#8220;now I&#8217;m
fixed good.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the sight of the grotesque waste a swift resentment
moved Gordon Makimmon&mdash;it was a mockery
of his money&#8217;s use, a gibing at his capability, his
planning. The petty treachery of Rose added its
injury. He pitched the box in his hands upon the
clay floor, and the accordion fell out, quivering like
a live thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey!&#8221; William Vibard remonstrated; &#8220;don&#8217;t do
like that&nbsp;...&nbsp;delicate&mdash;&#8221; He knelt, with an expression
of concern, and, tenderly fingering the instrument,
replaced it in the box.</p>
<p>Gordon turned sharply and returned to the house.
Rose was in her room. He could hear her moving
rapidly about, pulling at the bureau drawers. Depression
settled upon him; he carried the lantern
into the bedroom, where he sat bowed, troubled. He
was aroused finally by the faint strains of William&#8217;s
latest melodic effort drifting discreetly from the
stable.</p>
<p>The next morning the Vibards departed. Rose
was silent, her face, red and swollen, was vindictive.
On the back of the vehicle that conveyed them to the
parental Berrys was securely tied the square bundle
that had &#8220;fixed good&#8221; William Vibard musically for
life.</p>

<h2>XII</h2>
</div>

<p>Gordon Makimmon, absorbed in the
difficult and elusive calculations of his indefinable
project was unaware of the
change wrought by their departure, of the shifting of
the year, the familiar acts and living about him.
He looked up abruptly from the road when Valentine
Simmons, upon the platform of the store, arrested
his progress homeward.</p>
<p>Simmons&#8217; voice was high and shrill, as though
time had tightened and dried his vocal cords; his
cheeks were still round and pink, but they were sapless,
the color lingered like a film of desiccated
paint.</p>
<p>The store remained unchanged: Sampson, the
clerk, had gone, but another, identical in shirt
sleeves upheld by bowed elastics, was brushing the
counters with a turkey wing; the merchandise on the
shelves, unloaded from the slow procession of capacious
mountain wagons, flowed in endless, unvaried
stream to the scattered, upland homes.</p>
<p>Valentine Simmons took his familiar place in the
glass enclosure, revolving his chair to fix on Gordon
a birdlike attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an old friend,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;an old Presbyterian
friend, I want to lay some of my experience
before you. I want to complain a little, Gordon;
I have the right&nbsp;...&nbsp;my years, Pompey&#8217;s associate.
The fact is&mdash;you&#8217;re hurting the County, you&#8217;re hurting
the people and me; you&#8217;re hurting yourself.
Everybody is suffering from your&mdash;your mistaken
generosity. We have all become out of sorts, unbalanced,
from the exceptional condition you have
brought about. It won&#8217;t do, Gordon; credit has
been upset, we don&#8217;t know where we stand, or who&#8217;s
who; it&#8217;s bad.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said you suffered with the rest of us, but you
are worse off still. How shall I put it?&mdash;the
County is taking sad advantage of your, er&mdash;liberality.
There&#8217;s young Entriken; he was in the
store a little time ago and told me that you had
extended his note again. He thought it was smart
to hold out the money on you. There&#8217;s not a likelier
farm, nor better conditioned cattle, than his in
Greenstream. He could pay twenty notes like yours
in a day&#8217;s time. I hate to see money cheapened like
that, it ain&#8217;t healthy.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it you&#8217;re after, Gordon? Is it at the
incorruptible, the heavenly, treasure you&#8217;re aiming?
But if it is I&#8217;ll venture this&mdash;that the Lord doesn&#8217;t
love a fool. And the man with the talents, don&#8217;t
overlook him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not aiming at anything,&#8221; Gordon answered,
&#8220;I&#8217;m just doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And there&#8217;s that Hagan that got five thousand
from you, it&#8217;s an open fact about him. He came
from the other end of the state, clear from Norfolk,
to get a slice. He gave you the address, the employment,
of a kin in Greenstream and left for parts
unknown. No, no, the Lord doesn&#8217;t love a fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I may be a fool as you see me,&#8221; Gordon contended
stubbornly; &#8220;and the few liars that get my
money may laugh. But there&#8217;s this, there&#8217;s this,
Simmons&mdash;I&#8217;m not cursed by the dispossessed and
the ailing and the plumb penniless. I don&#8217;t go to a
man with his crop a failure on the field like, well&mdash;we&#8217;ll
say, Cannon does, with a note in my hand
for his breath. I&#8217;ve put a good few out of&mdash;of
Cannon&#8217;s reach. Did you forget that I know how
it feels to hear Ed Hincle, on the Courthouse steps,
call out my place for debt? Did you forget that
I sat in this office while you talked of old Presbyterian
friends and sold me into the street?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Incorrigible,&#8221; Valentine Simmons said, &#8220;incorrigible;
no sense of responsibility. I had hoped
Pompey&#8217;s estate would bring some out in you. But
I should have known&mdash;it&#8217;s the Makimmon blood;
you are the son of your father. I knew your grandfather
too, a man that fairly insulted opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve never been storekeepers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never kept much of anything, have you, any of
you? You can call it what you&#8217;ve a mind to, liberality
or shiftlessness. But there&#8217;s nothing saved
by names. There: it seems as if you never got civilized,
always contemptuous and violent-handed&nbsp;...&nbsp;it&#8217;s
the blood. I&#8217;ve studied considerable about
you lately; something&#8217;ll have to be done for the good
of all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it you want of me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Call in your bad debts,&#8221; the other promptly responded;
&#8220;shake off the worthless lot hanging to
your pocket. Put the money rate back where it belongs.
Why, in days gone by,&#8221; Valentine Simmons
chuckled, &#8220;seventy per cent wasn&#8217;t out of the way
for a forced loan, forty was just so-so. Ah, Pompey
and me made some close deals. Pompey multiplied
his talents. The County was an open ledger to
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you ever think of the men who had to
pay you seventy per cent?&#8221; Gordon asked, genuinely
curious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; Simmons retorted; &#8220;we educated
them, taught &#8217;em thrift. While you are promoting
idleness and loose-living.... But this is only an
opening for what I wanted to say.&mdash;I had a letter
last week from the Tennessee and Northern people,
the Buffalo plan has matured, they&#8217;re pushing the
construction right along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I intended to come to you about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t going on with our agreement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Simmons&#8217; face exhibited not a trace of concern.</p>
<p>&#8220;I may say,&#8221; he returned smoothly, &#8220;that I am
not completely surprised. I have been looking for
something of the kind. I must remind you that our
partnership is a legal and binding instrument; you
can&#8217;t break it, nor throw aside your responsibility,
with a few words. It will be an expensive business
for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to pay with what I&#8217;ve got.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other held up a palm in his familiar, arresting
gesture. &#8220;Nothing of that magnitude; nothing
out of the way; I only wanted to remind you
that a compensation should follow your decision.
It puts me in a very nice position indeed. I gather
from your refusal to continue the partnership that
you do not intend to execute singly the original plan;
it is possible that you will not hold the options
against the coming of transportation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got her,&#8221; Gordon declared; &#8220;I&#8217;m not
going to profit seventy times over, tie up all that
timber, from the ignorance of men that ought to
rightly advantage from it. I&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221; Gordon rose
to his feet in the harassing obscurity of his need;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to make! I don&#8217;t want to take anything&nbsp;...&nbsp;never
again! I want&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget, unfortunately, that I am forced to
be accessory to your&mdash;your change of heart. I
may say that I shall have to pay dearly for your&mdash;your
eleventh hour conversion. Timber will be&mdash;unsteady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you mention getting something out of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A mere detail to my effort, my time. What my
timber will be worth, with what you throw on the
market hawking up and down&nbsp;...&nbsp;problematic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon hesitated, a plan forming
vaguely, painfully, in his mind. Finally, &#8220;I might
buy you out,&#8221; he suggested; &#8220;if you didn&#8217;t ask too
dam&#8217; much. Then I could do as I pleased with the
whole lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that,&#8221; Valentine Simmons admitted, dryly
cordial, &#8220;is a plan worth consideration. We might
agree on a price, a low price to an old partner. You
met the Company&#8217;s agents, heard the agreement outlined;
a solid proposal. And, as you say, with the
timber control in your own hands, you could arrange
as you pleased with the people concerned.&#8221;</p>
<p>He grew silent, enveloped in thought. Then:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take a hundred thousand for all the options
I bought, for my interest in the partnership.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know as I could manage that,&#8221; Gordon
admitted.</p>
<p>An unassumed astonishment marked the other&#8217;s
countenance. &#8220;Why!&#8221; he ejaculated, &#8220;Pompey left
an estate estimated at&mdash;&#8221; he stopped from sheer
surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the investments went bad,&#8221; Gordon continued;
&#8220;down in Stenton they said I didn&#8217;t move
&#8217;em fast enough. Then the old man had a lot laid
out in ways I don&#8217;t hold with, with people I wouldn&#8217;t
collect from. And it&#8217;s a fact a big amount&#8217;s got out
here lately. Of course it will come back, the most
part.&#8221;</p>
<p>Simmons&#8217; expression grew skeptical.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you too,&#8221; Gordon added; &#8220;you&#8217;ll want
the price in your hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting on,&#8221; the storekeeper admitted; &#8220;I
can&#8217;t wait now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I can make it,&#8221; Gordon repeated;
&#8220;it&#8217;ll strip me if I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Valentine Simmons swung back to his desk. &#8220;At
least,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;keep this quiet till something&#8217;s
settled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon agreed.</p>

<p>Even if he proved able to buy out Simmons,
he thought walking home, it would be a
delicate operation to return the timber
rights to where he thought they belonged. He
considered the possibility of making a gift of the
options to the men from whom they had been wrongfully
obtained. But something of Simmons&#8217; shrewd
knowledge of the world, something of the priest&#8217;s
contemptuous arraignment of material values, lingering
in Gordon&#8217;s mind, convinced him of the potential
folly of that course. It would be more practical
to sell back the options to those from which
they had been purchased at the nominal prices paid.
He had only a vague idea of his balances at the
Stenton banks, the possibilities of the investments
from which he received profit. He was certain,
however, that the sum asked by Valentine Simmons
would obliterate his present resources. Yet he was
forced to admit that it did not seem exorbitant.</p>
<p>He continued his altruistic deliberations throughout
the evening at his dwelling. It might be well,
before investing such a paramount sum, to
communicate with the Tennessee and Northern Company,
receive a fresh ratification of their intention.
Yet he could not do that without incurring the danger
of premature questioning, investigation. It was
patent that he would have to be prepared to make an
immediate distribution of the options when his intention
became known in Greenstream. He was
aware that when the coming of a railroad to the
County became common knowledge the excitement of
the valley would grow intense.</p>
<p>Again, it might be better first to organize the timber
of Greenstream, so that a harmonious local condition
would facilitate all negotiations, and avert the
danger, which Valentine Simmons had pointed out,
of individual blindness and competition. But, in
order to accomplish that, he would have to bring into
concord fifty or more wary, suspicious, and largely
ignorant adults. He would have to deal with swift
and secret avarice, with vain golden dreams born of
years of bitter poverty, privation, ceaseless and incredible
toil. The magnitude of the latter task
appalled him; fact and figure whirled in his confused
mind. He was standing, and he suddenly felt
dizzy, and sat down. The giddiness vanished, but
left him with twitching fingers, a clouded vision.
He might get them all together, explain, persuade....
Goddy! it was for their good. They needn&#8217;t
be cross-grained. There it would be, the offer, for
them to take or leave. But, if they delayed, watch
out! Railroad people couldn&#8217;t be fooled with.
They might get left; that was all.</p>
<p>This, he felt, was more than he could undertake,
more than any reasonable person would ask. If he
paid Valentine Simmons all that money, and then let
them have back their own again, without a cent to
himself, they must be content. They should be able
to bargain as well as he&mdash;who was getting on and
had difficulty in adding figures to the same amount
twice&mdash;with the Tennessee and Northern.</p>
<p>The following morning he departed for Stenton.</p>

</div>

<p>Gordon paid Valentine Simmons eighty-nine
thousand dollars for the latter&#8217;s share
of the timber options they had held in common.
They were seated in the room in which Gordon
conducted his peculiar transactions. He turned
and placed Simmons&#8217; acknowledgment, the various
papers of the dissolved partnership, in the safe.</p>
<p>&#8220;That finishes all I had in Stenton,&#8221; he observed.</p>
<p>Valentine Simmons made no immediate reply.
He was intent, with tightly-folded lips, on the cheque
in his hand. His shirt, as ever, was immaculately
starched, the blue button was childlike, bland; but
it was cold without, and hot in the room where they
sat, and the color on his cheeks resembled dabs of
vermilion on buffers of old white leather; the tufts
of hair above his ears had dwindled to mere cottony
scraps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prompt and satisfactory,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;I
tell you, Gordon, you can see as far as another into a
transaction. Promises are of no account but value
received&nbsp;...&#8221; he held up the cheque, a strip of
pale orange paper, pinched between withered fingers.</p>
<p>Suddenly he was in a hurry to get away; he drew
his overcoat of close-haired, brown hide about his
narrow shoulders, and trotted to the door, to his
buggy awaiting him at the corner of the porch.</p>

<p>Gordon placed on the table before him the
statements and accounts of his newly-augmented
options. The papers, to his clerical
inefficiency, presented a bewildering mass of
inexplicable details and accounts. He brought
them, with vast difficulty, into a rough order. In the
lists of the acreages of timber controlled there were
appended none of the names of those from whom
his privilege of option had been obtained, no note
of the slightly-varying sums paid&mdash;the sole, paramount
facts to Gordon now. For the establishment
of these he was obliged to refer to the original, individual
contracts, to compare and add and check off.</p>
<p>Old Pompey had conducted his transactions
largely from his buggy, lending them a speciously
casual aspect. The options made to him were written
on slips of paper hastily torn from a cheap note
book, engrossed on yellowing sheets of foolscap in
tremulous Spencerian. Their wording was informal,
often strictly local. One granted privilege
of purchase of, &#8220;The piney trees on Pap&#8217;s and mine
but not Henny&#8217;s for nineteen years.&#8221; Another bore,
above the date, &#8220;In this year of Jesus Christ&#8217;s holy
redemption.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sales made to Valentine Simmons were, invariably,
formal in record, the signatures were all
witnessed.</p>
<p>It was a slow, fatiguing process. A number of
the original vendors, Gordon knew, had died, their
families were scattered; others had removed from
the County; logical substitutes had to be evolved.
The mere comparison of the various entries, the tracing
of the tracts to the amounts involved, was
scarcely within Gordon&#8217;s ability.</p>
<p>He labored through the swiftly-falling dusk into
the night, and took up the task early the following
morning. A large part of the work had to be done
a second, third, time&mdash;his brain, unaccustomed to
concentrated mental processes, soon grew weary; he
repeated aloud a fact of figures without the least
comprehension of the sounds formed by his lips, and
he would say them again and again, until he had
forced into his blurring mind some significance,
some connection.</p>
<p>He would fall asleep over his table, his scattered
papers, in the grey daylight, or in the radiance of a
large glass lamp, and stay immobile for hours, while
his dog lay at his feet, or, uneasy, nosed his sharp,
relaxed knees.</p>
<p>No one would seek him, enter his house, break his
exhausted slumbers. Lying on an outflung arm his
head with its sunken, closed eyes, loose lips, seemed
hardly more alive than the photographed clay of
Mrs. Hollidew in the sitting room. He would wake
slowly, confused; the dog would lick his inert hand,
and they would go together in search of food to the
kitchen.</p>
<p>On the occasions when he was forced to go to the
post-office, the store, he went hurriedly, secretively,
in a coat as green, as aged, as Pompey&#8217;s own.</p>
<p>He was anxious to finish his labor, to be released
from its responsibility, its weight. It appeared tremendously
difficult to consummate; it had developed
far beyond his expectation, his original conception.
The thought pursued him that some needy individual
would be overlooked, his claim neglected. No one
must be defrauded; all, all, must have their own,
must have their chance. He, Gordon Makimmon,
was seeing that they had, with Lettice&#8217;s money&nbsp;...&nbsp;because&nbsp;...&nbsp;because....</p>
<p>The leaves had been swept from the trees; the
mountains were gaunt, rocky, against swift, low
clouds. There was no sunlight except for a brief,
sullen red fire in the west at the end of day. At
night the winds blew bleakly down Greenstream valley.
Shutters were locked, shades drawn, in the village;
night obliterated it absolutely. No one
passed, after dark, on the road above.</p>
<p>He seemed to be toiling alone at a hopeless, interminable
task isolated in the midst of a vast,
uninhabited desolation, in a black chasm filled with
the sound of whirling leaves and threshing branches.</p>
<p>The morning, breaking late and grey and cold,
appeared equally difficult, barren, in vain. The
kitchen stove, continually neglected, went continually
out, the grate became clogged with ashes, the
chimney refused to draw. He relit it, on his knees,
the dog patiently at his side; he fanned the kindling
into flames, poured on the coal, the shining black
dust coruscating in instant, gold tracery. He
bedded the horse more warmly, fed him in a species
of mechanical, inattentive regularity.</p>
<p>Finally the list of timber options he possessed was
completed with the names of their original owners
and the amounts for which they had been bought.
A deep sense of satisfaction, of accomplishment, took
the place of his late anxiety. Even the weather
changed, became complacent&mdash;the valley was filled
with the blue mirage of Indian summer, the apparent
return of a warm, beneficent season. The decline of
the year seemed to halt, relent, in still, sunny hours.
It was as though nature, death, decay, had been arrested,
set at naught; that man might dwell forever
amid peaceful memories, slumberous vistas, lost in
that valley hidden by shimmering veils from all the
implacable forces that bring the alternation of cause
and effect upon subservient worlds and men.</p>

</div>

<p>As customary on Saturday noon Gordon
found his copy of the weekly <i>Bugle</i> projecting
from his numbered compartment at
the post-office. There were no letters. He thrust
the paper into his pocket, and returned to the village
street. The day was warm, but the mists that had
enveloped the peaks were dissolving, the sky was
sparkling, clear. By evening, Gordon decided, it
would be cold again, and then the long, rigorous
winter would close upon the valley and mountains.</p>
<p>He looked forward to it with relief, as a period of
somnolence and prolonged rest&mdash;the mental stress
and labor of the past days had wearied him of the
active contact with men and events. He was glad
that they were, practically, solved, at an end&mdash;the
towering columns of figures, the perplexing problems
of equity, the far-reaching decisions.</p>
<p>In rehearsing his course it seemed impossible to
have hit upon a better, a more comprehensive, plan.
There was hardly a family he knew of in the valley
of which some member might not now have his
chance. That, an opportunity for all, was what
Gordon was providing.</p>
<p>A number of horses were already hitched along
the rail outside Valentine Simmons&#8217; store; soon the
rail would hardly afford room for another animal.
He passed the Presbyterian Church, Dr. Pelliter&#8217;s
drugstore and dwelling, and approached his home.
Seen from the road the long roof was variously
colored from various additions; there were regions
of rusty tar-paper, of tin with blistered remnants of
dull red paint, of dark, irregular shingling.</p>
<p>It was a dwelling weather-beaten and worn, the
latest addition already discolored by the elements,
blended with the nondescript whole. It was like
himself, Gordon Makimmon recognized; in him, as
in the house below, things tedious or terrible had
happened, the echoes of which lingered within the
old walls, within his brain.... Now it was good
that winter was coming, when they would lie through
the long nights folded in snow, in beneficent quietude.</p>
<p>There were some final details to complete in his
papers. He took off his overcoat, laid it upon the
safe, and flung the <i>Bugle</i> on the table, where it fell
half open and neglected. The names traced by his
scratching pen brought clearly before him the individuals
designated: Elias Wellbogast had a long,
tangled grey beard and a gaze that peered anxiously
through a settling blindness. Thirty acres&mdash;eight
dollars an acre. P. Ville was a swarthy foreigner,
called, in Greenstream, the Portugee; every crop he
planted grew as if by magic. Old Matthew Zane
would endeavor to borrow from Gordon the
money with which to repurchase the option he had
granted.</p>
<p>He worked steadily, while the rectangles of sunlight
cast through the windows on the floor shortened
and shifted their place. He worked until the figures
swam before his eyes, when he laid aside the pen,
and picked up the <i>Bugle</i>, glancing carelessly over the
first page.</p>
<p>His attention immediately concentrated on the
headlines of the left-hand column, his gaze had
caught the words, &#8220;Tennessee and Northern.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goddy!&#8221; he exclaimed aloud; &#8220;they&#8217;ve got it in
the <i>Bugle</i>, the railroad coming and all.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was glad that the information had been
printed, it would materially assist in the announcement
and carrying out of his plan. He folded the
paper more compactly, leaned back in his chair to
read&nbsp;...&nbsp;Why!... Why, damn it! they had it
all wrong; they were entirely mistaken; they had
printed a deliberate&mdash;a deliberate&mdash;</p>
<p>He stopped reading to marshal his surprised and
scattered faculties. Then, with a rigid countenance,
he pursued the article to the end. When he had
finished his gaze remained subconsciously fastened
upon the paper, upon the advertisement of a man
who paid for and removed the bodies of dead animals.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon&#8217;s lips formed, barely audibly,
a name; he whispered, &#8220;Valentine Simmons.&#8221;</p>
<p>At last the storekeeper had utterly ruined him.
He raised the paper from where it had fallen and
read the article once more. It was a floridly and
violently written account of how a projected branch
of the Tennessee and Northern System through
Greenstream valley, long striven for by solid and
public-spirited citizens of the County, had been prevented
by the hidden avarice of a well-known local
figure, an ex-stage driver.</p>
<p>The latter, the account proceeded, with a foreknowledge
of the projected transportation, had secured
for little or nothing an option on practically all
the desirable timber of the valley, and had held it at
such a high figure that the railroad had been forced
to abandon the scheme.</p>
<p>&#8220;What Greenstream thus loses through blind
gluttony cannot be enumerated by a justly incensed
pen. The loss to us, to our sons and daughters....
This secret and sinister schemer hid his purpose, it
now appears, in a cloak of seeming benevolence.
We recall a feeling of doubt, which we generously
and wrongfully suppressed at the time, concerning
the motives of such ill-considered&nbsp;...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Valentine Simmons,&#8221; he repeated harshly. He
controlled the <i>Bugle</i> in addition to countless other
industries and interests of Greenstream. This article
could not have been printed without Simmons&#8217;
cognizance, his co-operation. It was the crown of
his long and victorious struggle with Gordon Makimmon.
The storekeeper had sold him the options
knowing that the railroad was not coming to the valley&mdash;some
inhibition had arisen in the negotiations&mdash;he
had destroyed him with Gordon&#8217;s own blindness,
credulity. And he had walked like a rat into
the trap.</p>
<p>The bitter irony of it rose in a wave of black mirth
to his twisted lips; he, Gordon Makimmon, was exposed
as an avaricious schemer with the prospects
of Greenstream, with men&#8217;s hopes, with their
chances. While Simmons, it was plainly intimated,
had labored faithfully and in vain for the people.</p>
<p>He rose and shook his clenched hands above his
head. &#8220;If I had only shot him!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;If
I had only shot him at first!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was too late now: nothing could be gained by
crushing the flickering vitality from that aged, pinkish
husk. It was, Gordon dimly realized, a greater
power than that contained by a single individual, by
Valentine Simmons, that had beaten him. It was a
stupendous and materialistic force against the metallic
sweep of which he had cast himself in vain&mdash;it
was the power, the unconquerable godhead, of gold.</p>
<p>The thought of the storekeeper was lost in the
realization of the collapse of all that he had laboriously
planned. The destruction was absolute; not
an inner desire nor need escaped; not a projection
remained. The papers before him, so painfully
comprehended, with such a determination of justice,
were but the visible marks of the futility, the waste,
of his dreaming.</p>
<p>He sank heavily into the chair before his table.
He recalled the younger Entriken&#8217;s smooth lies, the
debauchery of his money by the Nickles; William
Vibard&#8217;s accordions mocked him again&nbsp;...&nbsp;all, all,
had been in vain, worthless. General Jackson rose,
and laid his long, shaggy, heavy head upon Gordon&#8217;s
knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re done for,&#8221; he told the dog; &#8220;we&#8217;re finished
this time. Everything has gone to hell.&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt strangely lost in the sudden emptiness
of his existence, an existence that,
only a few hours before, had welcomed
the prospect of release from its bewildering fullness.
He had gathered the results of his slowly-formulating
consciousness, his tragic memory, to a final resolve
in the return of the options to a county enhanced
by the coming of a railroad whose benefits he
would distribute to all. And now the railroad was
no more than a myth, it had vanished into thin, false
air, carrying with it....</p>
<p>He swept his hand through the papers of his vain
endeavor, bringing a sudden confusion upon their
order. His arm struck the glass of shot, and, for a
short space, there was a continuous sharp patter on
the floor. He rose, and paced from wall to wall, a
bent shape with open, hanging hands and a straggling
grey wisp of hair across his dry, bony forehead.</p>
<p>Footsteps crossed the porch, a knock fell upon the
door, and Gordon responded without raising his
head.</p>
<p>It was Simeon Caley.</p>
<p>He had not been in the house since, together with
his wife, he had left it after Lettice&#8217;s death. Sim&#8217;s
stained felt hat was pushed back from a wet brow,
his gestures were urgent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get your horse in the buggy!&#8221; he exclaimed;
&#8220;I&#8217;ll help you. Light out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Light out&#8217;?&#8221; Gordon&#8217;s gaze centered upon the
other&#8217;s excitement, &#8220;where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t make much difference, so&#8217;s you
light. The County&#8217;s mad clear through, and it&#8217;s
pretty near all in the village.&#8221; Sim turned to the
door. &#8220;I&#8217;ll help you, and then&mdash;drive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t agoing to drive anywhere,&#8221; Gordon told
him; &#8220;I&#8217;m where I belong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t belong in Greenstream after that piece
in the <i>Bugle</i>,&#8221; his hand rested on the knob. &#8220;Tie
up anything you need, I&#8217;ll hitch the buggy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you touch a strap,&#8221; Gordon commanded;
&#8220;because I won&#8217;t put a foot in her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll all settle down in a little; then maybe you
can come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll settle down?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the deal with the railroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sim,&#8221; Gordon demanded sharply, &#8220;you never
believed that in the paper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to b&#8217;lieve,&#8221; the other replied
evasively; &#8220;a good many say those are the facts,
that you have the options.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out of here!&#8221; Gordon shouted in a sudden
moving rage; &#8220;and stay out; don&#8217;t come back when
you find what&#8217;s what.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I c&#8217;n do that. And I&#8217;ll point out to you we just
came for Lettice, we never took nothing of yours.
I only stopped now to warn you away&nbsp;...&nbsp;I&#8217;ll hitch
her up, Gordon; you get down the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mine now, whose ever it was awhile back.
I&#8217;ve paid for it. You go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Simeon Caley lingered reluctantly at the door.
Gordon stood rigidly; his eyes were bright points
of wrath, his arm rose, with a finger indicating the
world without. The former slowly opened the door,
stepped out upon the porch; he stayed a moment
more, then closed himself from sight.</p>

<p>The stir and heat of Sim&#8217;s presence died
quickly away; the house was without a
sound; General Jackson lay like an effigy
in ravelled black and buff wool. Gordon assembled
the scattered papers on the table into an orderly pile.
He moved into the kitchen, abstractedly surveyed
the familiar walls; he walked through the house to
the sitting room, where he stood lost in thought:</p>
<p>The County was &#8220;mad clear through&#8221;; Sim, supposing
him guilty, had warned him to escape, advised
him to run away.... That had never been
a habit of the Makimmons, he would not form it
now, at the end. He was not considering the mere
probability of being shot, but of the greater disaster
that had already smashed the spring of his living.
His sensibilities were deadened to any catastrophe of
the flesh.</p>
<p>At the same time he was conscious of a mounting
rage at being so gigantically misunderstood, and
his anger mingled with a bitter contempt for Simeon
Caley, for a people so blind, so credulous, so helpless
in the grasp of a single, shrewd individual.</p>
<p>He heard subdued voices without, and, through a
window, saw that the sweep by the stream was filling
with a sullen concourse of men; he saw their faces,
grim and resentful, turned toward the house; the
sun struck upon the dusty, black expanse of their
hats.</p>
<p>He walked deliberately through the bedroom and
out upon the porch. A sudden, profound silence
met his appearance, a shifting of feet, a concerted,
bald, inimical stare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; Gordon Makimmon demanded; &#8220;you&#8217;ve
read the <i>Bugle</i>, well?&#8221;</p>
<p>He heard a murmur from the back of the throng,</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it to him, we didn&#8217;t come here to talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Give it to him,&#8217;&#8221; Gordon repeated thinly. &#8220;I
see Ben Nickles there, behind that hulk from the
South Fork; Nickles&#8217;ll do it and glad. It will wipe
off the two hundred dollars he had out of me for a
new roof. Or there&#8217;s Entriken if Nickles is afraid,
his note falls due again soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the railroad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about it? Greenstream&#8217;s been settled for
eighty years, why haven&#8217;t you moved around and got
one? Do you expect the President of the Tennessee
and Northern to come up and beg you to let them
lay tracks to your doors? If you&#8217;d been men you&#8217;d
had one long ago, but you&#8217;re just&mdash;just stock. I&#8217;d
rather be an outlaw on the mountain than any of
you; I&#8217;d ruther be what you think I am; by God!&#8221;
he cried out of his bitterness of spirit, &#8220;but I&#8217;d ruther
be Valentine Simmons!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you got the options?&#8221; Entriken demanded&mdash;&#8220;all
them that Pompey had and you bought?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon vanished into the house, and reappeared
with the original contracts in his grasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here they are,&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;I paid eighty-nine
thousand dollars to get them, and they&#8217;re worth&mdash;that,&#8221;
he flung them with a quick gesture into the
air, and the rising wind scattered them fluttering
over the sere grass. &#8220;Scrabble for them in the dirt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You c&#8217;n throw them away now the railroad&#8217;s left
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And before,&#8221; Gordon Makimmon demanded,
&#8220;do you think I couldn&#8217;t have gutted you if I&#8217;d had
a mind to? do you think anybody couldn&#8217;t gut you?
Why, you&#8217;ve been the mutton of every little storekeeper
that let you off with a pound of coffee, of any
note shaver that could write. The <i>Bugle</i> says I let
out money to cover up the railway deal, but that&#8217;d be
no better than giving it to stop the sight of the blind.
God A&#8217;mighty! this transportation business you&#8217;re
only whining about now was laid out five years ago,
the company&#8217;s agents have driven in and out twenty
times....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him have it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Spite yourselves!&#8221; Gordon Makimmon cried;
&#8220;it&#8217;s all that&#8217;s left for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>General Jackson moved forward over the porch.
He growled in response to the menace of the throng
on the sod, and jumped down to their level. A sudden,
dangerous murmur rose:</p>
<p>&#8220;The two hundred dollar dog! The joke on
Greenstream!&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked alertly forward, his ears pricked up
on his long skull.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&#8217;m here, General,&#8221; Gordon called, suddenly
urgent; &#8220;c&#8217;m back here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dog hesitated, turned toward his master,
when a heavy stick, whirling out of the press of
men, struck the animal across the upper forelegs.
He fell forward, with a sharp whine, and attempted
vainly to rise. Both legs were broken. He looked
back again at Gordon, and then, growling, strove
to reach their assailants.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon started forward with a rasping
oath, but, before he could reach the ground, General
Jackson had propelled himself to the fringe of
humanity. He made a last, convulsive effort to rise,
his jaws snapped.... A short, iron bar descended
upon his head.</p>
<p>Gordon&#8217;s face became instantly, irrevocably, the
shrunken face of an old man.</p>
<p>The clustered men with the dead, mangled body
of the dog before them; the serene, sliding stream
beyond; the towering east range bathed in keen
sunlight, blurred, mingled, in his vision. He put out
a hand against one of the porch supports&mdash;a faded
shape of final and irremediable sorrow.</p>
<p>He exhibited neither the courage of resistance nor
the superiority of contempt; he offered, apparently,
nothing material whatsoever to satisfy the vengeance
of a populace cunningly defrauded of their just opportunities
and profits; he seemed to be no more
colored with life, no more instinct with sap, than the
crackling leaves blown by the increasing wind about
the uneasy feet on the grass.</p>
<p>He lipped a short, unintelligible period, gazing
intent and troubled at the throng. He shivered perceptibly:
under the hard blue sky the wind swept
with the sting of an icy knout. Then, turning his
obscure, infinitely dejected back upon the silent menace
of the bitter, sallow countenances, the harsh angular
forms, of Greenstream, he walked slowly to the
door. He paused, his hand upon the knob, as if arrested
by a memory, a realization. The door
opened; the house absorbed him, presented unbroken
its weather-worn face.</p>
<p>A deep, concerted sigh escaped from the men without,
as though, with the vanishing of that bowed and
shabby frame, they had seen vanish their last chance
for reprisal, for hope.</p>

</div>

<p>The cold sharpened; the sky, toward evening,
glittered like an emerald; the earth was
black, it resembled a ball of iron spinning
in the diffused green radiance of a dayless and glacial
void. The stream before the Makimmon dwelling
moved without a sound under banked ledges of
ice.</p>
<p>A thread of light appeared against the façade of
the house, it widened to an opening door, a brief
glimpse of a bald interior, and then revealed the
figure of a man with a lantern upon the porch. The
light descended to the ground, wavered toward a
spot where it disclosed the rigid, dead shape of a
dog. An uncertain hand followed the swell of the
ribs to the sunken side, attempted to free the clotted
hair on a crushed skull. The body was carefully
raised and enveloped in a sack, laboriously borne to
the edge of the silent stream.</p>
<p>There it was lost in the dark as the light moved
to where it cast a limited, swinging illumination over
the wall of a shed. It returned to the stiffly distended
sack, and there followed the ring of metal on
the iron-like earth. In the pale circle of the lantern
a figure stooped and rose, a figure with an intent,
furrowed countenance.</p>
<p>The digging took a long while, the frozen clods
of earth fell with a scattering thud, the shadow of
the hole deepened by imperceptible degrees. Once
the labor stopped, the sack was lowered into the
ragged grave; but the opening was too shallow, and
the rise and fall of the solitary figure recommenced.</p>
<p>The sack was finally covered from sight, from
the appalling frigidity and space of the sky, from the
frozen surface of the earth wrapped in stillness, in
night. The clods were scraped back into the hole,
stamped into an integral mass; the spade obliterated
all trace of what lay hidden beneath, returned to the
clay from which it had been momentarily animated
by the enigmatic, flitting spark of life.</p>
<p>The lantern retraced its path to the shed, to the
porch; where, in a brief thread of light, in the shutting
of a door, it disappeared.</p>

<p>Gordon met Valentine Simmons squarely
for the first time since the collapse of his
laborious planning outside the post-office.
The latter, with a senile and pleased chuckle, tapped
him on the chest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teach you to be provident, Gordon,&#8221; he said
in his high, rasping voice; &#8220;teach you to see further
than another through a transaction; as far ain&#8217;t near
enough; most don&#8217;t see at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The anger had evaporated from Gordon Makimmon&#8217;s
parched being: the storekeeper, he recognized,
was sharper than all the rest of the County combined;
even now the raddled old man was more
acute than the young and active intelligences. He
nodded, and would have passed on, but the storekeeper,
with a ponderous furred glove, halted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t had any satisfaction lately with the
Stenton stage,&#8221; he shrilled; &#8220;and I made out to ask&mdash;you
can take it or leave it&mdash;if you&#8217;d drive again?
It might be a kind of&mdash;he! he!&mdash;relax from your
securities and investments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon, without an immediate reply, regarded
him. He thought, in sudden approbation of a part,
at least, of the past, that he could drive a stage better
than any other man in a hundred, in a thousand;
there, at least, no humiliating failure had overtaken
his prowess with whip and reins. The old occupation,
the monotonous, restful miles of road sweeping
back under the wheels, the pleasant, casual detachment
of the passengers, the pride of accomplishment,
irresistibly appealed to him.</p>
<p>Valentine Simmons&#8217; rheumy eyes interrogated him
doubtfully above the fixed, dry color of his fallen
cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;By God, Valentine!&#8221; Gordon exclaimed, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
do it, I&#8217;ll drive her, and right, too. It takes experience
to carry a stage fifty miles over these mountains,
day and day; it takes a man that knows his horses,
when to slack up on &#8217;em and when to swing the
leather&nbsp;...&nbsp;I&#8217;m ready any time you say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The stage goes out from Greenstream to-morrow;
you can take it the trip after. Money same
as before. And, Gordon,&mdash;he! he!&mdash;don&#8217;t you
go and lend it out at four per cent; fifty&#8217;s talking
but seventy&#8217;s good. Pompey knew the trick, he&#8217;d
have dressed you down to an undershirt, Pompey
would.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon returned slowly, absorbed in new considerations,
to his dwelling. It was obvious that he
could not live there alone and drive the Stenton
stage; formerly Clare had attended to the house for
him, but now there was no one to keep the stoves lit,
to attend to the countless daily necessities. This
was Tuesday&mdash;he would take the stage out on
Thursday: he might as well get together a few necessities
and close the place at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll shut her right in,&#8221; he said aloud in the empty,
echoing kitchen.</p>
<p>He decided to touch nothing within. In the sitting
room the swift obscurity of the closing shutters
obliterated its familiar features&mdash;the table with the
lamp and pink celluloid thimble, the phonograph,
the faded photograph of what had been Mrs. Hollidew.
The darkness spread to the bedroom that had
been Lettice&#8217;s and his: the curtained wardrobe was
drawn, the bed lay smoothly sheeted with the quilt
folded brightly at the foot, one of the many small
glass lamps of the house stood filled upon the bureau.
The iron safe was eclipsed, the pens upright in the
glass of shot, the kitchen and spaces beyond.</p>
<p>Finally, depositing an ancient bag of crumbling
leather on the porch, he locked himself out. He
moved the bag to the back of the buggy, and, hitching
the horse into the worn gear, drove up the incline
to the public road, to the village, without once
turning his head.</p>

<p>He rose at five on Thursday and consumed a
hasty breakfast by a blur of artificial light
in the deserted hotel dining room. It was
pitch black without, the air heavy with moisture, and
penetrating. He led the horses from the shed under
which he had hitched them to the stage, and climbed
with his lantern into the long-familiar place by the
whip. A light streamed from the filmy window of
the post-office, falling upon tarnished nutcrackers
and picks in a faded plush-lined box ranged behind
the glass. Gordon could see the dark, moving bulk
of the postmaster within. The leather mail bags,
slippery in the wet atmosphere, were strapped in the
rear, and Gordon was tightening the reins when he
was hailed by a man running over the road. It was
Simmons&#8217; clerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old man says,&#8221; he shot between labored
breaths, &#8220;to keep a watch on Buck. Buckley&#8217;s coming
back with you to-morrow. He&#8217;s been down to
the hospital for a spell. There ain&#8217;t liable to be
anybody else on the stage this time of year.&#8221;</p>
<p>The horses walked swiftly, almost without
guidance, over the obscured way. The stage mounted,
turning over the long ascent to the crown of the east
range. Gordon put out the lantern. A faint grey
diluted the dark; the night sank thinly to morning,
a morning overcast with sluggish clouds; the bare
trees, growing slowly perceptible, dripped with moisture;
a treacherous film of mud overlaid the adamantine
road.</p>
<p>The day broke inexpressibly featureless and
dreary. The stage dropped to bald, brown valleys,
soggy fields and clear, hurrying streams; it rose deliberately
to heights blurred in aqueous vapors.
The moisture remained suspended throughout the
day; the grey pall hid Stenton as he drove up to the
tavern that formed his depot on the outskirts of the
city.</p>
<p>Later, in the solitude of his room, he heard the
hesitating patter of rain on the roof. He thought,
stretching his weary frame on the rigorous bed, that
if it turned cold through the night, the frozen road
would be dangerous to-morrow.</p>

<p>Buckley Simmons was late in arriving
from the hospital, and it was past seven before
the stage departed for Greenstream.
Buckley sat immediately back of Gordon Makimmon;
the former&#8217;s head, muffled in a long woolen
scarf, showed only his dull, unwitting gaze.</p>
<p>They rapidly left the dank stone streets and
houses. The smoke ascending from the waterworks
was no greyer than the day. The rain fell in small,
chill, gusty sweeps.</p>
<p>Gordon Makimmon settled resolutely to the long
drive; he was oblivious of the miles of sodden road
stretching out behind, he was not aware of the pale,
dripping, wintry landscape&mdash;he was lost in a continuous
train of memories wheeling bright and distant
through his mind. He was looking back upon
the features of the past as he might have looked at a
series of dissolving pictures, his interest in which
was solely that of spectator.</p>
<p>They were without unity, unintelligible in the
light of any concerted purpose or result. They
were, however, highly pleasant, or amazingly inexplicable.
For example:</p>
<p>His wife, Lettice, how young she was smiling at
him from the sunny grass! She walked happily
toward him, with her shawl about her shoulders,
but she didn&#8217;t reach him; she was sitting in the rocking
chair on the porch&nbsp;...&nbsp;the day faded, she was
singing a little throaty song, sewing upon a little
square of white&mdash;she was gone as swiftly, as utterly,
as a shadow. The shape of Meta Beggs, animated
with incomprehensible gestures, took its place in the
procession of his memories. She, grimacing, came
alike to naught, vanished. All stopped for a moment
and then disappeared, leaving no trace behind.</p>
<p>He mechanically arrested the horses before the
isolated buildings that formed the midday halt.</p>
<p>Buckley Simmons, crouching low over the table,
consumed his dinner with formless, guttural approbation.
The place above his forehead, where he
had been struck by the stone, was puckered and
dark. He raised his eyes&mdash;the unquenchable hatred
of Gordon Makimmon flared momentarily on his
vacuous countenance like the flame of a match lit
in the wind.</p>
<p>Once more on the road the rain stopped, the cold
increased; high above the earth the masses of cloud
gathered wind-herded in the south. The dripping
from the trees ceased, the black branches took on a
faint glitter; the distant crash of a falling limb
sounded from the woods.</p>
<p>Gordon, doubting whether the horses&#8217; shoes had
been lately roughed, descended, but, to his surprise,
found that the scoring had been properly maintained,
in spite of the fact that it had not had his
attention. He had little cause to swing the heavy
whip&mdash;the off horse, a raw-boned animal colored
yellowish-white, never ceased pulling valiantly on
the traces; he assumed not only his own share of
the labor but was willing to accept that of his
companion, and Gordon had continually to restrain
him.</p>
<p>The glitter spread transparently over the road;
the horses dug their hoofs firmly into the frozen
ruts. Suddenly a burst of sunlight enveloped the
land, and the land responded with an instant, intolerable
brilliancy, a blinding sheet of white radiance.
Every limb, every individual twig and blade of
grass, was covered with a sparkling, transparent
mail; every mound of brown earth scintillated in a
crisp surface of ice like chocolate confections glazed
in clear sugar. The clouds dissolved; the trees, encased
in crystal pipes, rose dazzling against a pale,
luminous blue expanse. Gigantic swords of incandescence
shifted over the mountainside; shoals of
frosty sparks filled the hollows; haloes immaculate
and uncompassionate hung above the hills.</p>
<p>Viewed from the necessity of the driver of the
Stenton stage this phenomenon was highly
undesirable,&mdash;the glassy road enormously increased the labor
of the horses; Gordon&#8217;s vigilance might not for
a minute be relaxed. The blazing sun blurred his
vision, the cold crept insidiously into his bones.
The stage slowly made its way into the valleys, over
the ranges; and, with it, the sun made its way over
valley and mountain toward the west.</p>
<p>At last the stage reached the foot of Buck Mountain;
beyond lay the village, the end of day. The
horses cautiously began the ascent, while Gordon,
watching their progress, lent them the assistance
of his judgment and voice. The road looped a
cleared field against the mountain, on the left an icy
slope fell away in a glittering tangle of underbrush.
The stage turned and the opening dropped upon the
right.</p>
<p>Gordon heard a thick, unintelligible sound from
behind, and, looking about, saw Buckley Simmons
clambering out over the wheel. He stopped the
horses, but Buckley slipped, fell upon the road.
However, he quickly scrambled erect, and walked
beside the stage, over the incline. His head was
completely hidden by the woollen scarf; in one hand
he carried a heavy switch. The road swung about
once more, and, at the turn, the fall was abrupt.
Buckley Simmons stumbled across the space that
separated him from the horses. And Gordon, with
an exclamation of incredulous surprise, saw the
other&#8217;s arm sweep up.&mdash;The switch fell viciously
across the back of the yellowish-white horse.</p>
<p>The animal plunged back, dragging his companion
against the stage. Gordon rose, lashing out
with his voice and whip; the horses struggled to
regain their foothold&nbsp;...&nbsp;slipped.... He felt
the seat dropping away behind him. Then, with a
violent wrench, a sliding crash, horses, stage and
man lurched down the incline.</p>

</div>

<p>Gordon Makimmon rose to a sitting
position on the glassy fall. Above him, to
the right, the stage lay collapsed, its wheels
broken in. Below the yellowish-white horse, upon
his back, drew his legs together, kicked out convulsively,
and then rolled over, lay still. From the
round belly the broken end of a shaft squarely projected.
The other horse was lost in a thrashing
thicket below.</p>
<p>Gordon exclaimed, &#8220;God A&#8217;mighty!&#8221; Then the
thought flashed through his mind that, extraordinarily,
he had not been hurt&mdash;he had fallen away from
the plunging hoofs, his heavy winter clothes had
preserved him from serious bruises. His face was
scratched, his teeth ached intolerably, but, beyond
that....</p>
<p>He rose shakily to his feet. As he moved a swift,
numbing pain shot from his right side, through his
shoulder to his brain, where, apparently, it centered
in a burning core of suffering. He choked unexpectedly
on a warm, thick, salty tide welling into
his throat. He said aloud, surprised, &#8220;Something&#8217;s
busted.&#8221;</p>
<p>He swayed, but preserved himself from falling,
and spat. Instantly there appeared before him on
the shining ice a blot of vivid, living scarlet.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s bad,&#8221; he added dully.</p>
<p>He must get up to the road, out of this damned
mess. The stage, he, had not fallen far; the road
was but a few yards above him, but the ascent, with
the pain licking through him like a burning tongue,
the unaccustomed, disconcerting choking in his
throat, was incredibly toilsome, long.</p>
<p>Buckley Simmons was standing on the road with
a lowered, vacant countenance, a face as empty of
content, of the trace of any purpose, as a washed
slate.</p>
<p>&#8220;You oughtn&#8217;t to have done that, Buck,&#8221; Gordon
told him impotently; &#8220;you ought never to have
done a thing like that. Why, just see....&#8221; Gordon
Makimmon&#8217;s voice was tremulous, his brain
blurred from shock. &#8220;You went and killed that off
horse, and a man never hitched a better. There&#8217;s
the mail, too; however it&#8217;ll get to Greenstream on
contract to-night I don&#8217;t know. That was the hell
of a thing to go and do!... off horse&nbsp;...&nbsp;willing&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The sky flamed in a transcendent glory of aureate
light; the molten gold poured in streams over the
land, dripped from the still branches. The crashing
of falling limbs sounded everywhere.</p>
<p>They were, Gordon knew, not half way up Buck
Mountain. There were no dwellings between them
and Greenstream village, no houses immediately at
their back. The road wound up before them toward
the pure splendor of sheer space. The cold
steadily increased. Gordon&#8217;s jaw chattered, and he
saw that Buckley&#8217;s face was pinched and blue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got to move,&#8221; Gordon articulated; &#8220;freeze out
here.&#8221; He lifted his feet, stamped them on the hard
earth, while the pain leaped and flamed in his side.
He labored up the ascent, but Buckley Simmons remained
where he was standing. I&#8217;ll let him stay,
Gordon decided, he can freeze to death and welcome,
no loss&nbsp;...&nbsp;after a thing like that. He moved
forward once more, but once more stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&#8217;m on,&#8221; he called impatiently; &#8220;you&#8217;ll take no
good here.&#8221; He retraced his steps, and roughly
grasped the other&#8217;s arm, urging him forward.
Buckley Simmons whimpered, but obeyed the pressure.</p>
<p>The long, toilsome course began, a trail of frequent
scarlet patches marking their way. Buckley
lagged behind, shaking with exhaustion and
chill, but Gordon commanded him on; he pulled
him over deep ruts, cursed him into renewed energy.
This dangerously delayed their progress.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got a good mind to leave you,&#8221; Gordon told
him; &#8220;something&#8217;s busted and I want to make the
village soon&#8217;s I can; and here you drag and hang
back. You did it all, too. C&#8217;m on, you dam&#8217;
fool: I could get along twice as smart without you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed to Gordon Makimmon that, as he
walked, the hurt within him was consuming flesh
and bone; it was eating away his brain. The thick,
salty taste persisted in his mouth, nauseating him.</p>
<p>The light faded swiftly to a mysterious violet
glimmer in the sky, on the ground, a cold phosphorescence
that seemed to emanate from the ice.</p>
<p>Buckley Simmons could scarcely proceed; he fell,
and Gordon drew him sharply to his feet. Finally
Gordon put an arm about his shoulder, steadying
him, forcing him on. He must hurry, he realized,
while the other held him back, delayed the assistance
that Gordon so desperately needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you,&#8221; he repeated querulously, &#8220;I got to
get along; something&#8217;s broke inside. I&#8217;ll leave
you,&#8221; he threatened; &#8220;I&#8217;ll let you sit right here and
go cold.&#8221; It was an empty threat; he struggled on,
giving Buckley his support, his determination, sharing
the ebbing store of his strength.</p>
<p>As they neared the top of the mountain a flood
of light colder than the ice poured from behind.
The moon had risen, transforming the world into a
crystal miracle.... Far below them was the
Greenstream valley, the village. They struggled
forward, an uncouth, slipping bulk, under the
soaring, dead planet. Gleams of light shot like quick-silver
about their feet, quivered in the clear gloom
like trails of pale fire igniting lakes of argent flame.
It was magnificent and cruel, a superb fantasy
rippling over treacherous rocks, rock-like earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Y&#8217; dam&#8217; idiot,&#8221; Gordon mumbled, &#8220;if I die out
here where&#8217;ll y&#8217; be then? I&#8217;d like to know that....
Don&#8217;t sit down on me again, I don&#8217;t know&#8217;s I could
get you up, don&#8217;t b&#8217;lieve I could. Like as not we
won&#8217;t make her. That was an awful good horse.
I&#8217;m under contract to&mdash;to&nbsp;...&nbsp;government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buckley Simmons sank to his knees: once more
Gordon kicked him erect. He spat and spat, constantly
growing weaker. &#8220;That&#8217;s an awful lot of
blood for a man to lose,&#8221; he complained.</p>
<p>Suddenly he saw upon the right the lighted square
of a window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; he exclaimed weakly, &#8220;here&#8217;s the valley.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pushed Buckley toward the door, and there
was an answering stir within&nbsp;...&nbsp;voices.</p>

</div>

<p>An overwhelming desire possessed Gordon
Makimmon to go home. He forgot the
pressing necessity for assistance, the searing
hurt within&nbsp;...&nbsp;he must go home. He stumbled
forward, turning into an aside that led directly behind
Dr. Pelliter&#8217;s drug store to the road above the
Makimmon dwelling. He moved blindly, instinctively,
following the way bitten beneath his consciousness
by a lifetime of usage.</p>
<p>The house was dark, but it was hardly darker
than Gordon&#8217;s brain. He climbed the steps to the
porch; his hands fumbled among the keys in his
pocket.</p>
<p>Feet tramped across the creaking boards, approaching
him; a palm fell upon his shoulder; a
crisp voice rang out uncomprehended at his ear. It
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d knocked on all the doors, and was just going.
I wanted to see you at once&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon felt over the door in search of the place
for the key.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say I wanted to see you,&#8221; the voice persisted;
&#8220;it&#8217;s Edgar Crandall. You&#8217;ll take pleasure from
what I&#8217;ve got to tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>The key slipped into its place and the bolt shot
back.... Well, he was home. No other thought,
no other consciousness, lingered in his mind; even
the pain, the unsupportable white core of suffering
in his brain, was dulled. He placed his foot upon the
threshold, but the hand upon his shoulder arrested
him:</p>
<p>&#8220;Greenstream&#8217;s going to have a bank,&#8221; the voice
triumphantly declared; &#8220;it&#8217;s settled&mdash;part outside
capital, part guaranteed right here. Paper shaving,
robbery, finished&nbsp;...&nbsp;lawful rate&nbsp;...&nbsp;chance&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>It was no more to Gordon Makimmon than the
crackling of the forest branches, no more than an
inexplicable hindrance to a desired consummation.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been for you, what you did for me&nbsp;...&nbsp;others&nbsp;...&nbsp;new
courage, example of bigness&mdash;Why!
what&#8217;s the matter with you, Makimmon?
That&#8217;s blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon made a tremendous effort of will, of grim
concentration. He freed himself from the detaining
hand. &#8220;Moment,&#8221; he pronounced. The single
word was expelled as dryly, as lifelessly, as a projectile,
from a throat insensate as the barrel of a
gun. He vanished into the bitterly cold house.</p>
<p>The bare floors echoed to his plodding footsteps
as he entered the bedroom beyond the dismantled
chamber of the safe. A flickering desire to see led
him to where, on the bureau, a lamp had been left.
The chimney fell with a crash of splintering glass
upon the floor, a match flared in his stiff fingers,
and the unprotected wick burned with a choking,
spectral blue light.</p>
<p>He saw, gazing at him from the black depths of
the mirror above the bureau, a haggard face drained
of all life, of all blood, with deep inky pools upon
the eyes. A sudden emotion stirred in the chill immobility
creeping upward through him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lettice!&#8221; he cried in a voice as flat as a spent
echo; &#8220;Lettice!&#8221;</p>
<p>He stumbled back, sinking.</p>
<p>Edgar Crandall found him kneeling at the bed,
his arms outflung across the counterpane, his head
bowed between, with a blackening stain beneath his
clay-cold lips, beneath his face scarred with immeasurable
suffering, fixed in a last surprise.</p>
